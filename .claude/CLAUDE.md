# Global Preferences

## Git
- **Never squash merge PRs.** Use regular merge (`gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`) to preserve individual commit history.
- **Always work on feature branches** — never commit directly to main. Create branch, dev plan, update docs, then PR.

## Commit Hygiene
- **Never use `git add -A`, `git add --all`, or `git add .`** — they sweep untracked scratch/dev-plan files into commits. A PreToolUse hook blocks these. Stage explicit paths.
- When a multi-step task touches multiple logical changes, split into separate commits with focused scope.

## Pre-Push Checks
- For Python projects: run `ruff format` AND `ruff check` before pushing — not just `check`. (A PostToolUse hook auto-formats on Edit/Write, but verify before push.)
- Run the full test suite locally before opening or updating a PR.

## Review Workflow
- **Verify the invariant, not just the tests.** Before declaring a structural fix complete (hashing, dedup, parity, state-machine), state the invariant and show concrete evidence (assertion, diff, log) that it holds across all call sites. Tests passing ≠ fix correct.
- After applying review fixes, re-verify the review-marker / plan-file hash before delegating further phases.
- Before running adversarial / Codex / multi-lens review, confirm the diff scope: print `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` and confirm it matches the feature branch, not the local worktree diff.

## Plan Updates
- When updating a dev plan, grep `docs/dev_plans/` (or equivalent) for sibling plans referencing the same feature/component and update them in the same pass — partial updates leave stale references.

## Workflow
- Discuss and plan before implementing non-trivial features.
- **If an approach is failing, stop and re-plan** — don't keep pushing on a broken path.
- Update docs (AGENTS.md, README.md, dev plan) alongside code changes, not after.
- Run `/update-docs`, `/review`, `/security-review`, and `/deep-review` before merging.
- Fix all review findings before merge.
- Update PR description to reflect final state of the work.
- **Verify before marking done** — run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness. Don't claim a task is complete without proof.

## Long-running Processes
- **Always pair background processes with a Monitor.** When starting any long-running process (dev server, ngrok, docker compose, log tail, background worker), run it with `Bash(run_in_background)` and immediately set up a `Monitor` on its output filtered for errors/warnings. This way the user can interact with the process (e.g., test in a browser) while Claude stays aware of server-side issues.
- Filter Monitor output: `grep --line-buffered -E "ERROR|WARN|Traceback|Exception|FATAL|panic"` — don't stream raw logs.

## Permissions
- Permissions are configured in `~/.claude/settings.local.json` with a broad allow list and explicit deny list (`rm`, `git rm`, `git merge`, `git reset --hard`, `git clean`, `git push --force`, package uninstalls, container deletion, `gh repo delete`, `gh pr close`).
- **Goal:** Claude should run long/overnight implementation tasks without permission prompts for non-destructive ops.
- If a safe command prompts during an autonomous run, note it — it should probably be added to the allow list.
- User has a `riskyclaude` alias for `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` but rarely uses it. Do not suggest it.

## Bug Fixing
- When given a bug with clear signals (logs, errors, failing tests), fix it autonomously. Don't ask for hand-holding.

## Code Changes
- **Minimal impact** — only touch what's necessary. Find root causes, no temporary hacks.

## MCP Tools
- When pipecat-context-hub MCP is available, always prefer its tools (`search_docs`, `search_api`, `search_examples`, `get_example`, `get_doc`, `get_code_snippet`) for Pipecat framework questions. Do not read `.venv` source directly.
- **Multi-concept queries:** When searching for multiple topics at once, use ` + ` or ` & ` as delimiters (e.g., `search_docs("TTS + STT")`, `search_examples("idle timeout + function calling + Gemini")`). Each concept is searched independently and results are interleaved for balanced coverage. Do NOT stuff multiple concepts into a single natural-language query.

## Destructive Operations
Destructive commands are blocked by the permissions deny list — they will prompt. When the prompt appears, apply these rules before approving:
- **Back up first.** Never `rm -rf` a data directory without `cp -a <dir> <dir>.bak`. Prefer moving to a `backups/` directory over permanent deletion.
- **Check for active writers** with `lsof +D <dir>` before deleting — a directory that looks like a duplicate may have a running process writing to it. A snapshot comparison is not enough.
- **SQLite databases:** never overwrite or delete wholesale. Merge row by row, always back up first.
- Applies to runtime data, caches, and databases — not just source code.

## Context Management
After completing a major task (commit, review, PR, skill run), assess the conversation:
- **Mid-task**: "We're mid-implementation on X — let's finish before managing context."
- **More related work remains**: Suggest `/compact focus on [specific next phase]`
- **Work is done or next task is independent**: Suggest `/clear` or provide a self-contained prompt to continue in a new session. Include: the goal, what's done, what's left, relevant file paths, and the branch name.

## Tool Output Discipline
Raw Bash/Read/Grep output lands in the transcript verbatim and stays for the rest of the session. Treat context as a budget. Apply these rules in order:

**1. Narrow inline commands before running them.** For commands I run myself, return only what I'll act on:
- `git log --oneline -N`, not `git log`
- `git diff --stat` or `--name-only` first; full diff only if needed
- `grep -l` (filenames) or `grep -c` (counts) when I just need existence
- `find ... | head -N`, `ls -1` not `ls -la` unless I need metadata
- Pipe verbose tooling through `grep -E "error|fail|warn"` or `tail -50`
- For Read, pass `limit`/`offset` when I know the region

**1a. Prefer faster modern CLIs when available.** They're terser by default and respect `.gitignore`, which alone cuts a lot of noise. Probe with `command -v <tool>` once per session before relying on it; fall back to the POSIX equivalent if missing.
- `rg` over `grep -r` / `find ... -exec grep` — faster, gitignore-aware, sensible defaults. `rg -l`, `rg -c`, `rg --files -g '*.ts'` for file listing.
- `fd` over `find` — `fd pattern` instead of `find . -name '*pattern*'`. Defaults to gitignore-aware, shorter syntax.
- `bat` over `cat` only when *I* need syntax-highlighted output for a human-facing summary; for tool reads, prefer the Read tool with `limit`/`offset`. `bat -p` (plain) if used in a pipe.
- `eza`/`exa` over `ls` for tree views (`eza --tree --level=2`).
- `jq` for JSON, `yq` for YAML — never grep structured data.
- `delta` for diffs only in interactive contexts; not in tool output (it adds ANSI noise).

**2. Delegate wide reads to a subagent with a shaped output contract.** When a task needs >3 lookups, spans multiple files, or produces structurally noisy output (test runs, build logs, multi-file audits), spawn an Agent. The subagent absorbs the raw tool noise; only its final message enters my context. Always specify the output contract in the prompt:
- "Report under 150 words. Bullet list of `path:line` matches only."
- "Return JSON: `{found: bool, paths: string[], reason: string}`."
- "Yes/no with one sentence of justification. No raw output."
- "Punch list: done vs missing. Under 200 words."

For pure lookups, prefer `subagent_type: Explore`. For verification/yes-no checks, use `general-purpose` with `model: "haiku"` — the overhead is worth it when raw output would otherwise be large.

**3. Decision rule — inline vs delegate:**
| Situation | Choice |
|---|---|
| One-shot, output naturally <30 lines | Inline, narrowed |
| Verbose by nature (build, test, deploy logs) | Inline + filter pipe, OR delegate if I only need a verdict |
| >3 greps, multi-file audit, "where is X used" | Delegate to Explore |
| Need yes/no, don't care about raw data | Delegate to Haiku subagent, ask for boolean |
| Will re-reference the output later in this session | Inline (delegating discards the detail) |

**4. Reuse prior reads, but verify freshness first.** If I already read a file this session, reuse that content — *unless* it may have changed since. The Edit/Write tools track state for files **I** modified, so re-reading after my own successful Edit is wasted. But the file may have changed for other reasons:
- A subagent or parallel Agent ran and may have edited it (worktree isolation aside).
- A PostToolUse hook rewrote it (e.g., `ruff format`, `prettier`, `eslint --fix`).
- The user edited it in their editor between turns.
- A build/codegen step (`tsc`, `protoc`, `cargo build`) regenerated it.
- A `git` operation changed working tree state (checkout, stash pop, rebase, merge).

Before relying on a cached read for a non-trivial decision (an Edit, a claim about contents, a security check), do a cheap freshness probe:
- `git status --short <path>` — shows if the file is dirty vs my last view of HEAD.
- `stat -f %m <path>` (macOS) / `stat -c %Y <path>` (Linux) — mtime check.
- For files inside a subagent's likely scope, just re-Read; the round-trip is cheaper than acting on stale content.

Rule of thumb: **read-then-edit in the same turn is safe; read-then-edit across a subagent call, hook fire, or user turn is not.**

## Security
- Before committing, check staged files for PII, private keys, secrets, and credentials. Never commit these.

## Auto-Memory Hygiene
- When writing a memory file, include a `last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD` field in the frontmatter (today's date).
- Before relying on a memory whose `last_verified` is **>14 days old**, re-verify its top claims against live state (file existence, git tags, branch HEADs) and either refresh `last_verified` or remove the memory. Stale memories caused real friction (e.g., trusting a 32-day-old roadmap; assuming v0.0.18 was tagged when it wasn't).
- Memory snapshots of repo activity (logs, architecture summaries) are frozen in time — for "current state" questions prefer `git log` / live reads over recall.
