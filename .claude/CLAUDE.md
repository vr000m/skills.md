# Global Preferences

## Git
- **Never squash merge PRs.** Use regular merge (`gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`) to preserve individual commit history.
- **Always work on feature branches** — never commit directly to main. Create branch, dev plan, update docs, then PR.

## Workflow
- Discuss and plan before implementing non-trivial features.
- **If an approach is failing, stop and re-plan** — don't keep pushing on a broken path.
- Update docs (AGENTS.md, README.md, dev plan) alongside code changes, not after.
- Run reviews (`/review`, `/security-review`) before merging.
- Fix all review findings before merge.
- Update PR description to reflect final state of the work.
- **Verify before marking done** — run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness. Don't claim a task is complete without proof.

## Bug Fixing
- When given a bug with clear signals (logs, errors, failing tests), fix it autonomously. Don't ask for hand-holding.

## Code Changes
- **Minimal impact** — only touch what's necessary. Find root causes, no temporary hacks.

## Security
- Before committing, check staged files for PII, private keys, secrets, and credentials. Never commit these.
