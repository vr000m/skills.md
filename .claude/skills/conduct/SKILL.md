# Conduct: Phased Delegation for Linear Implementation

Walk a reviewed dev-plan phase by phase. For each phase, spawn clean-context subagents (implementer + test-writer, and optionally a lightweight reviewer) to do the work. The conductor — main Claude running this skill — only reads structured JSON reports, routes failures through a bounded fix loop, commits at phase boundaries, and hands back to the user between phases.

Subagent prompt templates live alongside this file:

- `implementer-prompt.md`
- `test-writer-prompt.md`
- `reviewer-prompt.md`

Helper modules for preflight and state handling:

- `parser.py` — phase-heading regex, `Test command:` regex, phase-overlap check.
- `marker.py` — review-marker regex, final-line-only strip, hash compute, staleness check.
- `lock.py` — `fcntl.flock` advisory lock with atomic-`mkdir` fallback and 1-hour stale-break.
- `schema.py` — last-fenced-block extraction + role-specific report validation (raises `SchemaError`). Stdlib only.
- `runner.py` — test-command subprocess wrapper with portable wall-clock timeout via `subprocess.run(timeout=...)`. Returns `TestResult(returncode, output, timed_out, duration_seconds)`.

Deterministic tests under `tests/` (run via `uvx pytest .claude/skills/conduct/tests/ -v && bash .claude/skills/conduct/tests/test_skill_spawn_grep.sh`).

These helpers are a pure-Python library — there is no CLI entry point. Main Claude orchestrates the per-phase loop turn-by-turn per this SKILL.md: it calls helpers (preflight, phase parse, state read/write, pause/abort) via `python3 -c ...` in Bash for the pure-function steps, and invokes the `Agent` tool directly for each subagent spawn. The `Agent` spawn loop cannot be driven from Bash because the tool is synchronous within the parent turn.

## Delegation Pattern

Delegation depth from this skill is exactly 1: conduct → workers. Workers never spawn further subagents. This skill is invoked directly by the user as a top-level skill, OR inside a subprocess spawned by `/fan-out` that re-baselines depth at the process boundary. It is never invoked as an `Agent` subagent.

Subagents are spawned via the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: general-purpose`. Shared workspace — worktree isolation is the user's concern at the outer layer. Clean context comes from the `Agent` tool's default behaviour (no parent conversation history), not from filesystem separation.

## Invocation

```
conduct <plan-path>
conduct --resume <plan-path>
conduct --status <plan-path>
conduct --pause-phase <plan-path>
conduct --abort-run <plan-path>
```

### CLI flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--resume` | Resume after a handback. Reads state, picks up at the next unfinished phase. |
| `--status` | Print the state file contents and exit. No git ops. |
| `--pause-phase` | `git stash push -u -m "conduct-pause-phase-<N>"`, mark phase as user-paused, exit. State lives; `--resume` picks up. |
| `--abort-run` | Delete the state file and any stale lockfile/lockdir for this plan. No git ops, no stash. The more-destructive flag has the more-explicit name. |
| `--test-cmd CMD` | Override the phase's `Test command:` slot and any repo default. |
| `--test-timeout SECS` | Wall-clock cap on the test-runner subprocess. Default 300. |
| `--max-iterations N` | Fix-loop cap. Default 3. |

## Preflight

Before any phase runs, validate:

### 1. Plan path resolution

- If an argument is provided, use it.
- Else scan `docs/dev_plans/` for the most recently modified `.md` and use that.
- If no plan is found, tell the user and exit.

### 2. Review marker check

The plan MUST contain a marker line written by `/review-plan` after user acceptance:

```
<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD @ <sha1> -->
```

The marker acts as a **contract / workspace divider**. Everything above the marker is the immutable contract (objective, requirements, phase blocks, technical specs). Everything below is workspace — `## Progress` (per-phase completion), `## Findings` (durable notes), and similar. The hash covers the contract only, so editing the workspace during a run does NOT invalidate the marker.

- Match against regex `^<!-- reviewed: \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} @ [0-9a-f]{40} -->\s*$`. The last unfenced, column-zero match wins; marker-shaped text inside fenced code blocks or indented prose is ignored.
- Recompute the plan's content hash: take the plan with the marker line and everything after it stripped, pipe to `git hash-object --stdin`. Compare to the SHA recorded in the marker.
- If marker absent OR hash mismatches → hard-stop with: `Run: /review-plan <plan-path>` and exit.

### 3. Pre-commit health check

Run the repo's pre-commit / lint in non-fix mode on the current tree, in this order: `pre-commit run --all-files`, then `make lint`, then `npm run lint`, then `ruff check .`. If none exist, skip. If the check fails → hard-stop with: `Tree has pre-existing lint/hook failures; fix them before running this skill`.

This prevents subagent fix-loops from chasing issues they didn't introduce.

### 4. State file load

`<repo-root>/.conduct/state-<plan-basename>.json`, where repo-root comes from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.

- If present and `--resume`: load and continue from `phase_index`. Refresh `state.resume_base_sha = git rev-parse HEAD` so the rogue-commit check (Step 8) treats any user commits made during handback as the new phase baseline rather than as subagent commits.
- If present without `--resume`: warn, print state summary, suggest `--resume` or `--abort-run`, exit.
- If absent: initialise with `base_sha = git rev-parse HEAD`, `phase_index = 0`, `iteration_count = 0`, `status = "running"`.

Acquire an advisory lock on `.conduct/state-<plan-basename>.json.lock` before any write (see `lock.py` shipped with this skill).

### 5. Phase parsing

Parse phases from the `## Implementation Checklist` section with regex:

```
^###\s+Phase\s+(\S+?)\s*[:—–]\s*(.+?)\s*(\([^)]*\))?\s*$
```

Captures the phase label (e.g. `3` or `3a`) and title; strips trailing parenthesised annotations. The label/title separator may be a colon (`:`), em-dash (`—`), or en-dash (`–`) — LLM-authored plans often default to em-dash, so the parser tolerates all three rather than forcing a manual rewrite. Record each phase's 0-based document position (used as `phase_position` in reports) and verbatim label (used as `phase_label`).

Phase completion is sourced from the `## Progress` section below the marker. Each entry has the form `- [ ] Phase <label>: <title>` (or `- [x] ...` when done). The conductor reads this section to skip phases that have already finished. Old-format plans without a Progress section fall back to in-body checkbox state for backward compatibility.

## Per-Phase Workflow

For each unfinished phase, execute steps 1–9. Acquire the state-file lock before any state mutation.

**On entering a new phase**: reset `state.iteration_count = 0` and persist before Step 1. The fix-loop cap is per-phase, not per-run; without this reset, phase N starts already counting iterations spent on phase N−1 and the cap fires prematurely.

### Step 1 — Parse phase contract

From the phase block, extract:

- `**Impl files:**` — comma-separated paths, globs allowed.
- `**Test files:**` — comma-separated paths, globs allowed.
- `` **Test command:** `<cmd>` `` — parsed with `^\*\*Test command:\*\*\s+\x60([^\x60]+)\x60\s*$`; first match wins; additional matches emit a warning.
- `` **Validation cmd:** `<cmd>` `` — optional. Runs after tests pass, before the boundary commit. Same shell-trust boundary as `Test command:`. Failure triggers handback (status `awaiting_user`), NOT the fix loop — validation typically exercises live-data or external-service behaviour an implementer cannot auto-repair. See Step 5b below.

Any slot may be absent; see Fallbacks below. If an entire run's unfinished phases declare zero slots, the conductor emits a one-shot warning on the first handback (degraded-mode notice: "fill slots in the plan to enable parallel spawn and real test runs").

### Step 2 — Parallel vs sequential decision

- If `Impl files:` and `Test files:` resolve to disjoint paths → parallel spawn.
- If they overlap (same file, or one is a subpath of the other) → sequential (implementer first, then test-writer).
- If either slot is missing → sequential (safe default).

Log the decision in the phase summary: `Spawn strategy: parallel` or `Spawn strategy: sequential (reason: file overlap | missing slot)`.

### Step 3 — Fill and spawn subagent prompts

Read `implementer-prompt.md`, extract the fenced ` ``` ` Template block, substitute placeholders:

| Placeholder | Value | JSON type concern |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| `{{PLAN_PATH}}` | absolute path | string |
| `{{PHASE_INDEX}}` | phase's 0-based position | substitute bare int (no quotes) |
| `{{PHASE_LABEL}}` | verbatim heading label | substitute JSON-escaped string |
| `{{PHASE_TITLE}}` | verbatim heading title | string (appears in prose, not JSON) |
| `{{ITERATION}}` | current fix-loop iteration | substitute bare int (no quotes) |
| `{{BASE_SHA}}` | `git rev-parse HEAD` at phase start | string |
| `{{PRIOR_DIFF}}` | staged diff from previous attempt, else empty | string |
| `{{TEST_FAILURES}}` | test-runner or pre-commit hook output, else empty | string |

Same pattern for `test-writer-prompt.md` (placeholders: plan path, phase index, phase label, phase title, base sha, existing-tests summary) and `reviewer-prompt.md` (plan path, phase index, phase label, phase title, diff).

Spawn via the `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: general-purpose`, with the filled template as the full prompt. Do not thread parent conversation context. In parallel mode, issue both Agent tool calls in a single message.

### Step 4 — Await both, parse reports

Each subagent returns a final fenced ` ```json ` block. Parse rules:

- **Anchor on the LAST fenced `json` block** in the output, not the first. The plan or prompt body may contain schema examples; only the terminal block is the report.
- Validate via `schema.parse_report(text, expected_role)` — this performs the last-block extraction, JSON parse, and role-specific schema check. Required top-level keys: `role`, `phase_position`, `phase_label`, `iteration` for impl/test roles, plus role-specific fields (`findings` for reviewer; `files_changed`/`summary` for implementer; `test_files_added`/`test_commands`/`coverage_summary` for test-writer). For implementer and test-writer the `flags` object is also validated by key: implementer must emit `blocked` (bool), `test_contract_mismatch` (bool), `needs_test_coverage` (list); test-writer must emit `blocked` (bool) and `needs_impl_clarification` (string or null). Reviewer does not emit `flags`. Extra keys (top-level or inside `flags`) are allowed so prompts can evolve without breaking older conductors.
- If `parse_report` raises `SchemaError` → set `state.status = "schema_error"`, record which subagent failed, the error message, and the raw output tail in state, handback to the user. Do NOT respawn. A clean-context respawn cannot consume "your last output was malformed" because the fresh subagent has no memory of the prior attempt.

### Step 5 — Run tests

Resolve the test command in order:

1. `--test-cmd` CLI flag.
2. Phase's `**Test command:**` line.
3. Repo default: `package.json` `scripts.test`, `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, or `Makefile` `test` target.
4. None available → emit warning, skip tests, set `state.last_summary` with the skip flag, proceed directly to Step 8 (commit boundary).

Run the resolved command via `runner.run_tests(cmd, timeout=<secs>)` (`--test-timeout`, default 300). The wall clock is enforced by Python's `subprocess.run(timeout=...)` so behaviour is identical on Linux and macOS without depending on GNU coreutils `timeout`. On timeout the runner kills the process group, sets `timed_out = True`, and the conductor treats the result as a fix-loop failure with the killed-by-timeout note appended to the captured output.

On non-zero exit → Step 6. On zero exit → Step 5b (if a validation command is present), else Step 7.

### Step 5b — Optional validation command

If the phase declares a `**Validation cmd:**` slot, run it via the same `runner.run_tests` subprocess wrapper after tests pass. Semantics differ from Step 5 in two ways:

1. **No fix loop on failure.** A non-zero exit or timeout sets `state.status = "awaiting_user"` with `state.blocker = "Phase <label> validation failed"`, persists the last 2000 bytes of output as the diagnostic, and hands back. The user inspects the output and decides whether to patch the plan, re-invoke with `--resume`, or abort. A failing validation typically means the live-data or external-service behaviour being exercised cannot be fixed by respawning the implementer (e.g. a reprocess-and-diff check against a real database).
2. **No subagent spawn.** Validation is a direct subprocess, not an Agent call. It shares the `Test command:` trust boundary — the plan author is authorising what gets executed.

On zero exit, append `"validation passed"` to the phase warnings and continue to Step 7.

### Step 6 — Fix loop (bounded at N = `--max-iterations`, default 3)

No classifier. On any failure (test failure OR pre-commit hook failure at the boundary commit in Step 8):

- Increment `state.iteration_count`. Persist state immediately (crash recovery).
- If `iteration_count > N`: set `state.status = "blocked"`, handback with message `Phase <label> stalled after <N> iterations; see .conduct/state-<plan>.json for diff and failure history.` Do not auto-advance.
- Else **reset the index before respawn**: capture `git diff --cached` into `{{PRIOR_DIFF}}`, then run `git reset` (mixed, no `--hard`) to clear the staging area. The respawned implementer starts from a clean index with the prior diff visible only inside its prompt — this prevents stale staged content from a failed attempt silently mixing into the next iteration.
- Respawn the implementer with `{{ITERATION}}` = new count, `{{PRIOR_DIFF}}` = the captured diff, `{{TEST_FAILURES}}` = full runner output (or hook output, if the failure came from the boundary commit).
- Exception: if the previous implementer report set `flags.test_contract_mismatch: true`, respawn the **test-writer** instead on this iteration, same inputs. Reset the flag handling for the iteration after that (respawn implementer again unless the next report flips the flag again).

### Step 7 — Optional mid-phase reviewer (one-shot)

Trigger conditions: staged diff > 200 lines, OR > 3 files touched, OR phase tagged high-risk in the plan's Review Focus section. If triggered, spawn one reviewer subagent using `reviewer-prompt.md` with `{{DIFF}}` = staged diff. Log findings into the phase summary. Never loop the reviewer. Findings do not block phase completion — the conductor is advisory here, not gating.

### Step 8 — Phase-boundary commit

After tests pass (or were skipped with warning):

1. **Rogue-commit check.** Compare `git rev-parse HEAD` to the phase-start baseline: `state.resume_base_sha` if this run started from `--resume`, otherwise `state.base_sha` (for phase 1) or the last completed phase's `commit_sha` (walking back past any `commit_sha: null` entries — those are rogue-commit records, not real baselines). If HEAD advanced beyond the baseline _during this phase's subagent work_, a subagent committed despite the prompt directive. Do NOT stack another commit. Record `rogue_commit_sha` in the phase entry, set `commit_sha: null`, set `state.status = "awaiting_user"` with a warning, handback. (User commits made during a previous handback are absorbed into `resume_base_sha` at preflight, so they do not trip this check.)
2. **No-op branch.** If `git diff --cached` is empty (the phase resolved to a diagnostic-only or accepted-behaviour outcome with no code change), skip the commit: record the phase entry with `commit_sha` = current `HEAD` (unchanged), add `no_op: true`, emit warning `no staged changes; skipping commit`, and proceed to Step 9. Do NOT use `--allow-empty`. The next phase's baseline falls through to this unchanged HEAD correctly.
3. Otherwise run `git commit -m "conduct: phase <label> — <phase title>"`. Commit author = current git user (no impersonation).
4. If the pre-commit hook fails, first check whether the hook modified files in-place (formatters like black, ruff --fix, prettier). If `git diff --name-only` is non-empty at this point, run `git add -u` and retry the commit **once** in-place with the same message. If the retry succeeds, append the warning `pre-commit hook modified files; re-staged and retrying` to the phase warnings and continue at step 5 as a normal success. If the retry also fails, or if the hook did not modify files, route the hook output back into Step 6 as a fix-loop iteration. Do NOT use `--no-verify`. The one-shot retry applies only to the formatter case — a hook that reports a genuine logic error (e.g. a test hook) will fail both attempts and correctly fall through to the fix loop.
5. On success, record the new `HEAD` SHA in `state.completed_phases[*].commit_sha`. **This field is immutable once written.** If the user lands follow-up commits during handback (for example after `/deep-review`), the `--resume` preflight absorbs them into `resume_base_sha` for the rogue-commit check — it does NOT rewrite the previous phase's `commit_sha` to point at the follow-up. The phase entry records the conductor-authored boundary commit only; post-phase fixups live on the branch but are not re-attributed.

### Step 9 — Handback

At every phase boundary:

1. Print a structured phase summary:
   - Phase label and title
   - Files changed
   - Spawn strategy (parallel | sequential)
   - Test result (passed | skipped-with-warning)
   - Iterations used
   - Mid-phase reviewer findings if any
   - Any warnings (rogue commit, missing test command, skipped tests)
2. Print the literal next command, on its own line:
   ```
   Run: /conduct --resume <plan-path>
   ```
3. Set `state.status = "awaiting_user"`, persist, release lock, exit the skill.

No keyword heuristic watches for "proceed" — the user copies the printed command when ready.

## Fallbacks

- Missing `Impl files:` / `Test files:` → sequential spawn (Step 2).
- Missing `Test command:`, no repo default, no `--test-cmd` → warn, skip tests for the phase, flag in handback summary (Step 5).
- Missing Testing Notes entirely → same as above; phase completes on implementer-only success with the skip flag.
- Plan has zero unfinished phases → print `All phases complete` and exit.

## State File

Path: `<repo-root>/.conduct/state-<plan-basename>.json`. `.conduct/` is git-ignored (Phase 5).

Schema:

```json
{
  "plan_path": "docs/dev_plans/20260422-feature-conduct-skill.md",
  "plan_content_hash": "<sha1 of plan with marker stripped>",
  "base_sha": "<git sha before phase 1>",
  "resume_base_sha": "<git sha at the start of this --resume invocation; absent on first run>",
  "phase_index": 3,
  "current_phase_title": "...",
  "completed_phases": [
    { "index": 1, "label": "1", "title": "...", "commit_sha": "...", "tests": "passed", "iterations": 1 }
  ],
  // Optional per-entry fields (written only when the condition fires):
  //   "no_op": true              — Step 8 no-op branch; commit_sha is the unchanged HEAD.
  //   "rogue_commit_sha": "..."  — subagent committed during phase; commit_sha is null,
  //                                this records what HEAD advanced to.
  //   "diagnostic_finding": "..."— narrative recorded when a phase resolves without code
  //                                change; paired with no_op or a null commit_sha.
  // "commit_sha" is immutable once written; it is NOT updated if the user amends or

  "last_summary": "...",
  "iteration_count": 0,
  "status": "awaiting_user | running | paused | blocked | schema_error | complete",
  "blocker": null
}
```

### Locking

- Primary: `lock.py` acquires `fcntl.flock` on `<state-file>.lock` fd.
- Fallback if Python is unavailable: atomic `mkdir <state-file>.lockdir`.
- Stale locks older than 1 hour are broken with a warning.
- `flock(1)` is NOT used — unavailable by default on macOS.
- Two `/conduct` invocations on the same plan in the same worktree race on the same lock. Sibling worktrees resolve to distinct repo-roots via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and therefore distinct state files.

## Trust Boundary

**The plan's `Test command:` slot is executed as a shell command** (via `runner.run_tests` with `shell=True`). Running `/conduct` on a plan is therefore equivalent in trust to running `make test`, `npm test`, or `cargo test` on a branch you checked out — the plan author chooses what gets executed.

Treat a dev plan received from someone else (a teammate's branch, an external PR, a forwarded file) the same way you'd treat a `Makefile` or `package.json` from that source: read it before running. Preflight validates the review marker to confirm the plan hasn't drifted since it was reviewed, but the marker is a content hash, not a cryptographic signature of the reviewer — it does not attest that anyone trustworthy approved the command.

If you need a stronger guarantee, review the phase `Test command:` lines before running `/conduct`, or override with `--test-cmd <your-own-cmd>` to ignore the plan's slot entirely.

## Known Limitations

- **No agent wall-clock timeout.** The `Agent` tool is synchronous within the parent turn and exposes no PID, so `--agent-timeout` is not enforceable in v1. Mitigated by the fix-loop cap plus explicit iteration counts in prompts. Test-runner timeout is real because the test command is a subprocess.
- **Rogue commits are detected, not prevented.** Subagents are instructed to stage only; a subagent that runs `git commit` anyway is caught by the HEAD-comparison check in Step 8, flagged in state, and handed back to the user rather than auto-corrected.
- **Schema errors do not retry.** A subagent that emits malformed JSON triggers `schema_error` status and immediate handback. The user decides whether to adjust the prompt template or re-invoke.
- **State-file path collision on same-basename plans.** Claude's state file is `.conduct/state-<plan-basename>.json`. Two plans with the same basename at different paths (e.g., `docs/dev_plans/foo.md` and `archive/foo.md`) map to the same state file — last writer wins. The Codex mirror disambiguates via `state-<basename>-<digest>.json`; aligning the Claude side is tracked in `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Workaround until then: keep plan basenames unique, or pass distinct `--plan-id`-style overrides if one exists.
- **Resume gating is advisory on Claude, enforced on Codex.** Claude loads any existing state file unconditionally; `opts.resume` only refreshes `resume_base_sha`. Codex hard-stops on `state_exists and not --resume`. In practice the orchestrator is expected to pass `--resume` when resuming, but Claude will not refuse if you forget.
- **Clean-context enforcement is instruction-based on Claude.** Codex enforces worker isolation at the harness layer via `fork_context: false` in its SKILL frontmatter. Claude relies on the "Do not thread parent conversation context" instruction being followed by main Claude. Same intended behaviour; weaker enforcement.

## Integration Points

- **Plan format**: `/dev-plan` owns the template. Phases need `**Impl files:**`, `**Test files:**`, and `` **Test command:** `<cmd>` `` slots in the contract section above the marker. Per-phase progress lives in a `## Progress` section below the marker.
- **Review marker**: `/review-plan` writes the marker line after user acceptance. The marker divides the plan into immutable contract (above, hashed) and editable workspace (below, not hashed). This skill consumes the marker as the readiness signal.
- **Fan-out**: a `/fan-out`-spawned Claude subprocess may invoke `/conduct` as its top-level skill; `/conduct` itself does not fan out.
