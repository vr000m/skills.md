## Implementation Checklist

The Implementation Checklist is part of the **immutable contract** above the review marker. Phase blocks describe what the work is — the contract slots `/conduct` reads to decide how to spawn subagents and run tests. They MUST NOT be edited during a run; per-phase progress and findings live in the workspace section below the marker so editing them does not invalidate the marker.

Each phase SHOULD include a short contract block directly under the heading. Fill the slots in **every** phase you expect `/conduct` to execute — a phase with no slots falls through to degraded mode (sequential spawn + test fallback) and forfeits the parallel implementer/test-writer split.

- `**Impl files:**` — comma-separated paths or globs the implementer will touch (e.g., `src/foo.py, src/bar/*.ts`)
- `**Test files:**` — comma-separated paths or globs the test-writer will create/modify
- `**Test command:**` — the single canonical test invocation for this phase, in backticks (e.g., ``**Test command:** `pytest tests/test_foo.py -v` ``)
- `**Validation cmd:**` *(optional)* — a post-test check that runs after tests pass, before the boundary commit, in backticks (e.g., ``**Validation cmd:** `python scripts/reprocess_and_diff.py --ids X,Y` ``). Failure hands back to the user rather than triggering a fix loop. Use for reprocess-and-diff against a live DB, staging API probes, or other behaviour an implementer cannot auto-repair.

If `Impl files:` and `Test files:` overlap, `/conduct` falls back to sequential spawning for that phase. If any slot is absent, `/conduct` falls back to safe defaults (sequential spawn, resolve test command from repo defaults or `--test-cmd`). If *every* unfinished phase is missing every slot, `/conduct` emits a degraded-mode warning on the first handback.

Phase task descriptions are plain bullets, not checkboxes — completion lives in the `## Progress` section below the marker, keyed by phase label.

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

**Impl files:** `path/to/foo.ts, path/to/bar.ts`
**Test files:** `tests/test_foo.ts`
**Test command:** `npm test -- tests/test_foo.ts`
**Validation cmd:** `npm run smoke -- --env staging`

- Task 1
- Task 2
- Task 3

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]

**Impl files:** `...`
**Test files:** `...`
**Test command:** `...`

- Task 1
- Task 2

### Phase 3: [Phase Name] (if needed)

**Impl files:** `...`
**Test files:** `...`
**Test command:** `...`

- Task 1
- Task 2

## Technical Specifications

### Files to Modify
- `path/to/file1.ts` - [what changes]
- `path/to/file2.ts` - [what changes]

### New Files to Create
- `path/to/new-file.ts` - [purpose]

### Architecture Decisions
- Decision 1: [rationale]
- Decision 2: [rationale]

### Dependencies
- [Any new dependencies or integrations]

### Integration Seams

Cross-component boundaries where one task's output feeds into another's input.
Fill this in before using `/fan-out` — it tells each agent what contracts to honor
and tells the merge phase what to verify.

| Seam | Writer (task) | Caller (task) | Contract |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| [e.g., cleanup on refresh] | [IndexStore] | [cli.py] | [Must delete stale records before upsert] |

For each seam, consider: who calls it, resource lifecycle (open/close), error paths, and idempotency.

<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD @ <hash> -->
<!-- /review-plan writes the marker line above. Everything below is the workspace: edits here do NOT invalidate the marker. -->

## Progress

Per-phase completion tracked here so ticking a box during a run does not bust the review marker. `/conduct` reads this section to skip already-done phases. Format: `- [ ] Phase <label>: <title>`.

- [ ] Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Phase 2: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Phase 3: [Phase Name]

## Findings

Durable notes that survive after the run: diagnostic query results (with explicit filters stated), decision rationale, "checked / accepted behaviour" outcomes. Group by phase if useful.
