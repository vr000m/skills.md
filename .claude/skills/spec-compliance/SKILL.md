# Spec Compliance Check

Given code and a specification reference, fetch the spec section, extract normative requirements (RFC 2119: MUST, SHOULD, MAY), and map each requirement against the code. Return a structured compliance report.

Supports IETF RFCs, IETF Internet-Drafts, W3C specifications, WHATWG specs, and any publicly accessible standards document.

## Usage

- `/spec-compliance src/nack.py RFC 4585 Section 6.2.1` — Check code against an RFC section
- `/spec-compliance src/peer.js "W3C WebRTC 1.0" Section 4.4.1` — Check against a W3C spec
- `/spec-compliance src/quic.rs https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-17.2` — Check against a direct URL
- `/spec-compliance src/handler.go draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures Section 3` — Check against an IETF draft

## Step 1: Parse the Input

Identify two things from the user's request:

1. **Code source** — a file path, line range, or inline code snippet
2. **Spec reference** — one of:
   - RFC number + optional section (e.g., "RFC 4585 Section 6.2.1")
   - IETF draft name + optional section (e.g., "draft-ietf-rmcat-gcc Section 5")
   - W3C/WHATWG spec name + optional section (e.g., "W3C WebRTC 1.0 Section 4.4.1")
   - Direct URL to a spec section

If the section is not specified, ask the user which section to check — full-spec compliance is too broad to be useful.

If the code path is not specified, ask the user to provide it.

## Steps 2–5: Resolve Spec, Fetch Requirements, Analyse Code, Return Report (Subagent)

These steps involve heavy WebSearch/WebFetch for spec text and Grep/Read across the codebase — delegate them to a subagent to keep the main context lean.

### Pre-flight (main context)

Before spawning the subagent, read the code file(s) identified in Step 1 using the `Read` tool and capture the content. This ensures the subagent has everything it needs without referencing the conversation.

### Subagent delegation

**Use the Agent tool** with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and `model: "opus"` to spawn a single subagent. Pass it the following self-contained prompt (fill in `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}`):

````
You are performing a spec compliance check — mapping normative requirements from a specification against code to produce a structured compliance report.

## Inputs

- **Code path**: {{CODE_PATH}}
- **Code content**:
```
{{CODE_CONTENT}}
```
- **Spec reference**: {{SPEC_REFERENCE}} (e.g., "RFC 4585 Section 6.2.1" or a direct URL)

## Step 2: Resolve the Spec

Map the reference to a fetchable URL:

| Reference Format | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `RFC XXXX` | `https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfcXXXX` |
| `RFC XXXX Section X.Y` | `https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfcXXXX#section-X.Y` |
| `draft-*` | `https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/<draft-name>/` — check if it became a published RFC; if so, use the RFC instead |
| W3C spec name | Use `WebSearch` to find the spec URL on `w3.org` or `spec.whatwg.org` |
| Direct URL | Use as-is |

Use `WebSearch` to resolve named specs. Use `WebFetch` to load the spec content.

If the spec or section cannot be found, return an error message suggesting alternatives. Do not proceed with guessed content.

## Step 3: Fetch and Extract Requirements

Load the spec section via `WebFetch`. Extract normative statements by identifying RFC 2119 keywords as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174):

- **MUST** / **MUST NOT** / **REQUIRED** / **SHALL** / **SHALL NOT** — absolute requirements
- **SHOULD** / **SHOULD NOT** / **RECOMMENDED** — strong recommendations with justified exceptions
- **MAY** / **OPTIONAL** — truly optional

Per RFC 8174, these keywords only have normative meaning when they appear in ALL CAPITALS. Lowercase "must", "should", "may" are normal English and should be ignored.

For W3C/WHATWG specs that use their own conformance language (e.g., "User agents MUST", "This is a willful violation"), apply the same extraction approach — look for capitalised conformance keywords.

List each extracted requirement with a short identifier for use in the report.

If the section contains no normative language, report that finding and suggest checking adjacent sections or the parent section.

## Step 4: Analyse Code

For each extracted requirement:

1. Search the provided code content for evidence that the requirement is implemented — look for relevant control flow, validation, constants, comments, and tests
2. Use `Grep` to find relevant patterns (function names, constants, conditionals) in the project. If not found in the target file, check adjacent modules and test files before classifying as Missing
3. Classify each requirement:
   - **Met** — code clearly implements the requirement; cite the line(s)
   - **Missing** — no evidence the requirement is addressed
   - **Partial** — requirement is partly addressed but incomplete; explain the gap
   - **N/A** — requirement does not apply to this code's role (e.g., a sender-side requirement checked against receiver code)

When classifying, be conservative: if you are uncertain whether code meets a requirement, mark it as **Partial** with an explanation rather than **Met**.

## Step 5: Return the Report

Return your findings in exactly this format (no other output):

```
## Spec Compliance Report

**Code**: `path/to/file.ext` (lines X-Y)
**Spec**: RFC XXXX, Section X.Y — "Section Title"
**Source**: [link to spec section]
**Requirements found**: N total (X MUST, Y SHOULD, Z MAY)

### MUST Requirements

1. ✅ **Met** — "MUST do X"
   Evidence: line 42 — `relevant_code_here`

2. ❌ **Missing** — "MUST NOT do Y"
   No handling found for this case in the code.

3. ⚠️ **Partial** — "MUST include Z"
   Line 58 constructs Z but does not handle the edge case described in the spec.

### SHOULD Requirements

1. ✅ **Met** — "SHOULD do A"
   Evidence: line 73 — `relevant_code_here`

### MAY Requirements

1. ➖ **N/A** — "MAY support B"
   This is a receiver-side requirement; the code implements the sender.

### Summary

| Level | Met | Missing | Partial | N/A | Total |
|-------|-----|---------|---------|-----|-------|
| MUST  |   X |       X |       X |   X |     X |
| SHOULD|   X |       X |       X |   X |     X |
| MAY   |   X |       X |       X |   X |     X |
```
````

### After the subagent returns

Present the compliance report to the user as-is.

### Report Rules

- Use status icons to prefix each finding: ✅ Met, ❌ Missing, ⚠️ Partial, ➖ N/A
- Quote only the specific normative statement being checked — do not reproduce surrounding spec text
- Always include line-number evidence for Met and Partial findings
- Group by requirement level (MUST first, then SHOULD, then MAY)
- Include the summary table for quick scanning — always include all three rows (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) even if a level has zero requirements
- Link to the spec section so the user can read the full context

### What NOT to Do

- Do NOT reproduce large blocks of spec text — quote only the normative statement
- Do NOT mark a requirement as Met unless you can cite specific code evidence
- Do NOT skip SHOULD/MAY requirements — they matter for interoperability even if not mandatory
- Do NOT guess what the spec says — always fetch and verify
- Do NOT attempt full-spec compliance without a section reference — ask the user to narrow scope

## Edge Cases

- **Spec section not found**: Report the error, suggest checking the section number or searching for the topic. Offer to use `rfc-finder` to locate the right document.
- **No normative language in section**: Report that no RFC 2119 keywords were found. Suggest checking the parent section or a different section.
- **Code file too large**: Ask the user for a line range or function name to narrow the scope.
- **Multiple spec sections**: If the user references multiple sections, check each one separately with its own report section.
- **Ambiguous spec reference**: If the reference could match multiple specs, list the candidates and ask the user to clarify.
- **Non-English specs**: This skill only handles English-language specifications.

## Examples

**User**: `/spec-compliance src/rtcp/nack.rs RFC 4585 Section 6.2.1`

**Response**:

## Spec Compliance Report

**Code**: `src/rtcp/nack.rs` (lines 1-95)
**Spec**: RFC 4585, Section 6.2.1 — "Generic NACK"
**Source**: [RFC 4585 §6.2.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4585#section-6.2.1)
**Requirements found**: 4 total (3 MUST, 1 SHOULD)

### MUST Requirements

1. ✅ **Met** — "MUST set PT=RTPFB and FMT=1"
   Evidence: line 34 — `header.pt = PT_RTPFB; header.fmt = 1;`

2. ✅ **Met** — "The FCI field MUST contain at least one and MAY contain more than one Generic NACK"
   Evidence: line 52 — `assert!(!nack_list.is_empty());`

3. ⚠️ **Partial** — "MUST NOT send a Generic NACK for packets not yet expected"
   Line 61 checks `seq < max_seq` but does not account for sequence number wrapping at 2^16.

### SHOULD Requirements

1. ❌ **Missing** — "SHOULD be used in conjunction with the retransmission payload format (RFC 4588)"
   No RFC 4588 retransmission handling found in this file or adjacent modules.
