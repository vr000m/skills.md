# Conduct: Phased Delegation for Linear Implementation

Walk a reviewed dev-plan phase by phase. For each phase, spawn clean-context subagents (implementer + test-writer, and optionally a lightweight reviewer) to do the work. The conductor — main Codex running this skill — only reads structured JSON reports, routes failures through a bounded fix loop, commits at phase boundaries, and hands back to the user between phases.

Subagent prompt templates live alongside this file:

- `implementer-prompt.md`
- `test-writer-prompt.md`
- `reviewer-prompt.md`

Helper modules for preflight and state handling:

- `parser.py` — phase-heading regex, `Test command:` / `Validation cmd:` regexes, phase-overlap check.
- `marker.py` — review-marker regex, contract/workspace split, hash compute, staleness check.
- `lock.py` — `fcntl.flock` advisory lock with atomic-`mkdir` fallback and 1-hour stale-break.
- `schema.py` — last-fenced-block extraction + role-specific report validation (raises `SchemaError`). Stdlib only.
- `runner.py` — test-command subprocess wrapper with portable wall-clock timeout via a dedicated subprocess session plus explicit process-group termination. Returns `TestResult(returncode, output, timed_out, duration_seconds)`.

Deterministic tests under `tests/` (run via `uvx pytest .codex/skills/conduct/tests/ -v && bash .codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_skill_spawn_grep.sh`).

These helpers are a pure-Python library — there is no CLI entry point. Main Codex orchestrates the per-phase loop turn-by-turn per this SKILL.md: it calls helpers (preflight, phase parse, state read/write, pause/abort) for the pure-function steps, and invokes `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, and `close_agent` directly for each subagent lifecycle. Each worker must be spawned with `fork_context=false` so the filled template is the worker's entire context.

## Delegation Pattern

Delegation depth from this skill is exactly 1: conduct → workers. Workers never spawn further subagents. This skill is invoked directly by the user as a top-level skill, OR inside a Codex session spawned by `/fan-out` that re-baselines depth at the process boundary. It is never invoked as a worker subagent.

Subagents are spawned via `spawn_agent` with `fork_context=false`. Shared workspace — worktree isolation is the user's concern at the outer layer. Clean context comes from explicitly not forking the parent conversation, not from filesystem separation.

## Delegation Availability

Codex `/conduct` does **not** silently degrade into inline main-session implementation when delegated workers are unavailable. If the current runtime lacks `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, or `close_agent`, hard-stop with this message and do no phase work:

```text
Delegated subagents unavailable in this Codex runtime; the conduct skill requires spawn_agent, wait_agent, and close_agent support.
```

The user can then rerun `/conduct` in a Codex session with agent delegation support or execute the phase manually.

## Invocation

```
conduct <plan-path>
conduct --resume <plan-path>
conduct --status <plan-path>
conduct --pause-phase <plan-path>
conduct --abort-run <plan-path>
```

### CLI flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--resume` | Resume after a handback. Reads state, picks up at the next unfinished phase. |
| `--status` | Print the state file contents and exit. No git ops. |
| `--pause-phase` | `git stash push -u -m "conduct-pause-phase-<N>"`, record the created stash in state, mark phase as user-paused, exit. `--resume` restores that recorded stash before continuing. |
| `--abort-run` | Delete the state file for this plan once the state lock is free. If another `/conduct` run is active, exit non-destructively and tell the user to retry. No git ops, no stash. |
| `--test-cmd CMD` | Override the phase's `Test command:` slot and any repo default. |
| `--test-timeout SECS` | Wall-clock cap on the test-runner subprocess. Default 300. |
| `--max-iterations N` | Fix-loop cap. Default 3. |

## Preflight

Before any phase runs, validate:

### 1. Plan path resolution

- If an argument is provided, use it.
- Else scan `docs/dev_plans/` for the most recently modified `.md` and use that.
- If no plan is found, tell the user and exit.

### 2. Review marker check

The plan MUST contain a marker line written by `/review-plan` after user acceptance:

```
<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD @ <sha1> -->
```

The marker acts as a **contract / workspace divider**. Everything above the marker is the immutable contract (objective, requirements, phase blocks, technical specs). Everything below is workspace — `## Progress` (per-phase completion), `## Findings` (durable notes), and similar. The hash covers the contract only, so editing the workspace during a run does NOT invalidate the marker.

- Match against regex `^<!-- reviewed: \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} @ [0-9a-f]{40} -->\s*$`. The last unfenced, column-zero match wins; marker-shaped text inside fenced code blocks or indented prose is ignored.
- Recompute the plan's content hash: take the plan with the marker line and everything after it stripped, pipe to `git hash-object --stdin`. Compare to the SHA recorded in the marker.
- If marker absent OR hash mismatches → hard-stop with: `Run: /review-plan <plan-path>` and exit.

### 3. Optional pre-commit health check

Preflight does **not** automatically execute repo-defined lint entrypoints. If the caller explicitly supplies a lint/preflight check, run it and hard-stop on failure with: `Tree has pre-existing lint/hook failures; fix them before running this skill`.

### 4. State file load

`<repo-root>/.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json`, where repo-root comes from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and `plan-id` is the plan basename plus a short hash of its repo-relative path.

- If present and `--resume`: load only when both `state.plan_path` and `state.plan_content_hash` still match the current reviewed plan. Migrate/validate the stored state shape first. On match, restore any recorded paused stash, continue from `phase_index`, and refresh `state.resume_base_sha = git rev-parse HEAD` so the rogue-commit check (Step 8) treats any user commits made during handback as the new phase baseline rather than as subagent commits.
- If present and the stored plan path/hash do not match the current reviewed plan: hard-stop and tell the user to `--abort-run` before starting over.
- If present without `--resume`: warn, print state summary, suggest `--resume` or `--abort-run`, exit without entering the phase loop.
- If absent: initialise with `plan_content_hash = compute_plan_hash(plan)`, `base_sha = git rev-parse HEAD`, `phase_index = 0`, `current_phase_title = ""`, `last_summary = ""`, `iteration_count = 0`, `status = "running"`.

Acquire an advisory lock on `.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json.lock` before any write (see `lock.py` shipped with this skill).

### 5. Phase parsing

Parse phases from the `## Implementation Checklist` section with regex:

```
^###\s+Phase\s+(\S+?)\s*[:—–]\s*(.+?)\s*(\([^)]*\))?\s*$
```

Captures the phase label (e.g. `3` or `3a`) and title; strips trailing parenthesised annotations. The label/title separator may be a colon (`:`), em-dash (`—`), or en-dash (`–`) — LLM-authored plans often default to em-dash, so the parser tolerates all three rather than forcing a manual rewrite. Record each phase's 0-based document position (used as `phase_position` in reports) and verbatim label (used as `phase_label`).

Phase completion is sourced from the `## Progress` section below the marker. Each entry has the form `- [ ] Phase <label>: <title>` (or `- [x] ...` when done). The conductor reads this section to skip phases that have already finished. Old-format plans without a Progress section fall back to in-body checkbox state for backward compatibility.

If every unfinished phase omits every contract slot (`Impl files:`, `Test files:`, `Test command:`, `Validation cmd:`), continue in degraded mode but queue a one-shot warning for the first handback: the user should see that they lost parallel spawn and explicit test/validation wiring.

## Per-Phase Workflow

For each unfinished phase, execute steps 1–9. Acquire the state-file lock before any state mutation.

**On entering a new phase**: reset `state.iteration_count = 0` and persist before Step 1. The fix-loop cap is per-phase, not per-run; without this reset, phase N starts already counting iterations spent on phase N−1 and the cap fires prematurely.

### Step 1 — Parse phase contract

From the phase block, extract:

- `**Impl files:**` — comma-separated paths, globs allowed.
- `**Test files:**` — comma-separated paths, globs allowed.
- `` **Test command:** `<cmd>` `` — parsed with `^\*\*Test command:\*\*\s+\x60([^\x60]+)\x60\s*$`; first match wins; additional matches emit a warning.
- `` **Validation cmd:** `<cmd>` `` — optional, parsed with `^\*\*Validation cmd:\*\*\s+\x60([^\x60]+)\x60\s*$`; first match wins; additional matches emit a warning.

Any slot may be absent; see Fallbacks below.

### Step 2 — Parallel vs sequential decision

- If `Impl files:` and `Test files:` resolve to disjoint paths → parallel spawn.
- If they overlap (same file, or one is a subpath of the other) → sequential (implementer first, then test-writer).
- If either slot is missing → sequential (safe default).

Log the decision in the phase summary: `Spawn strategy: parallel` or `Spawn strategy: sequential (reason: file overlap | missing slot)`.

### Step 3 — Fill and spawn subagent prompts

Read `implementer-prompt.md`, extract the fenced ` ``` ` Template block, substitute placeholders:

| Placeholder | Value | JSON type concern |
|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| `{{PLAN_PATH}}` | absolute path | string |
| `{{PHASE_INDEX}}` | phase's 0-based position | substitute bare int (no quotes) |
| `{{PHASE_LABEL}}` | verbatim heading label | substitute JSON-escaped string |
| `{{PHASE_TITLE}}` | verbatim heading title | string (appears in prose, not JSON) |
| `{{ITERATION}}` | current fix-loop iteration | substitute bare int (no quotes) |
| `{{BASE_SHA}}` | `git rev-parse HEAD` at phase start | string |
| `{{PRIOR_DIFF}}` | staged diff from previous attempt, else empty | string |
| `{{TEST_FAILURES}}` | redacted failure summary from the test runner or pre-commit hook, else empty | string |

Same pattern for `test-writer-prompt.md` (placeholders: plan path, phase index, phase label, phase title, base sha, existing-tests summary) and `reviewer-prompt.md` (plan path, phase index, phase label, phase title, diff).

Spawn via `spawn_agent` with the filled template as the worker's full `message`, `fork_context=false`, and a worker-oriented agent type. In parallel mode, spawn implementer and test-writer back-to-back, then use `wait_agent` to await whichever completes first until both have returned final output. After each worker reaches a terminal status, call `close_agent` to clean it up.

### Step 4 — Await both, parse reports

Each subagent returns a final fenced ` ```json ` block. Parse rules:

- **Anchor on the LAST fenced `json` block** in the output, not the first. The plan or prompt body may contain schema examples; only the terminal block is the report.
- Validate via `schema.parse_report(text, expected_role)` — this performs the last-block extraction, JSON parse, and role-specific schema check. Required top-level keys: `role`, `phase_position`, `phase_label`, `iteration` for impl/test roles, plus role-specific fields (`findings` for reviewer; `files_changed`/`summary` for implementer; `test_files_added`/`test_commands`/`coverage_summary` for test-writer). For implementer and test-writer the `flags` object is also validated by key: implementer must emit `blocked` (bool), `test_contract_mismatch` (bool), `needs_test_coverage` (list); test-writer must emit `blocked` (bool) and `needs_impl_clarification` (string or null). Reviewer does not emit `flags`. Extra keys (top-level or inside `flags`) are allowed so prompts can evolve without breaking older conductors.
- If `parse_report` raises `SchemaError` → set `state.status = "schema_error"`, record which subagent failed, the error message, and the raw output tail in state, handback to the user. Do NOT respawn. A clean-context respawn cannot consume "your last output was malformed" because the fresh subagent has no memory of the prior attempt.
- If a worker report sets `flags.blocked = true`, or a test-writer reports `needs_impl_clarification`, persist `state.status = "blocked"` with the worker's explanation and hand back immediately. Do not run tests or commit staged changes after an explicit worker blocker.

### Step 5 — Run tests

Resolve the test command in order:

1. `--test-cmd` CLI flag.
2. Phase's `**Test command:**` line.
3. Repo default: `package.json` `scripts.test`, `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, or `Makefile` `test` target.
4. None available → emit warning, skip tests, still run Step 5b if a `Validation cmd:` is present, then proceed to Step 8 (commit boundary).

Run the resolved command via `runner.run_tests(cmd, timeout=<secs>)` (`--test-timeout`, default 300). The runner starts the test command in its own subprocess session and, on timeout, terminates the full process group so behaviour is identical on Linux and macOS without depending on GNU coreutils `timeout`. On timeout the runner kills the process group, sets `timed_out = True`, and the conductor treats the result as a fix-loop failure with the killed-by-timeout note appended to the captured output.

On non-zero exit → Step 6. On zero exit → Step 5b (if a validation command is present), else Step 7.

### Step 5b — Optional validation command

If the phase declares a `**Validation cmd:**` slot, run it via the same `runner.run_tests` subprocess wrapper after tests pass. If Step 5 skipped tests because no test command was available, still run validation before the boundary commit. Semantics differ from Step 5 in two ways:

1. **No fix loop on failure.** A non-zero exit or timeout sets `state.status = "awaiting_user"` with `state.blocker = "Phase <label> validation failed"`, persists the blocker state, and hands back with the last 2000 bytes of validation output as the diagnostic. Validation failures do not append a completed-phase entry and do not create a third `commit_sha: null` state branch.
2. **Same trust boundary as Test command.** The plan author chose this shell command. Review it with the same care as `Test command:` before you run `/conduct`.

On zero exit, append `"validation passed"` to the phase warnings and continue to Step 7.

### Step 6 — Fix loop (bounded at N = `--max-iterations`, default 3)

No classifier. On any failure (test failure OR pre-commit hook failure at the boundary commit in Step 8):

- Increment `state.iteration_count`. Persist state immediately (crash recovery).
- If `iteration_count > N`: set `state.status = "blocked"`, handback with message `Phase <label> stalled after <N> iterations; see .conduct/state-<plan-id>.json for diff and failure history.` Do not auto-advance.
- Else capture `git diff --cached` into `{{PRIOR_DIFF}}`. Normally then run `git reset` (mixed, no `--hard`) to clear the staging area so the respawned implementer starts from a clean index with the prior diff visible only inside its prompt.
- Respawn the implementer with `{{ITERATION}}` = new count, `{{PRIOR_DIFF}}` = the captured diff, `{{TEST_FAILURES}}` = a redacted failure summary (or pre-commit hook summary, if the failure came from the boundary commit).
- Exception: if the previous implementer report set `flags.test_contract_mismatch: true`, respawn the **test-writer** instead on this iteration and keep the previously staged implementation diff in the index so the follow-up commit can still include the original implementation work plus the newly staged tests. Reset the flag handling for the iteration after that (respawn implementer again unless the next report flips the flag again).

### Step 7 — Optional mid-phase reviewer (one-shot)

Trigger conditions: staged diff > 200 lines, OR > 3 files touched, OR phase tagged high-risk in the plan's Review Focus section. If triggered, spawn one reviewer subagent using `reviewer-prompt.md` with `{{DIFF}}` = staged diff. Log findings into the phase summary. Never loop the reviewer. Findings do not block phase completion — the conductor is advisory here, not gating.

### Step 8 — Phase-boundary commit

After tests pass (or were skipped with warning):

1. **Rogue-commit check.** Compare `git rev-parse HEAD` to the phase-start baseline: `state.resume_base_sha` if this run started from `--resume`, otherwise `state.base_sha` (for phase 1) or the last completed phase's `commit_sha`. If HEAD advanced beyond the baseline _during this phase's subagent work_, a subagent committed despite the prompt directive. Do NOT stack another commit. Record `rogue_commit_sha` in the phase summary, set `state.status = "awaiting_user"` with a warning, handback. (User commits made during a previous handback are absorbed into `resume_base_sha` at preflight, so they do not trip this check.)
2. Otherwise run `git commit -m "conduct: phase <label> — <phase title>"`. Commit author = current git user (no impersonation).
3. If the pre-commit hook fails, first check whether the hook modified files in-place (formatters like black, ruff --fix, prettier). Only auto-restage when every modified tracked file is already in the original staged pathset for this phase; in that case, run `git add -u -- <staged-paths...>` and retry the commit **once** in-place with the same message. If the retry succeeds, append the warning `pre-commit hook modified files; re-staged and retrying` to the phase warnings and continue at step 4 as a normal success. If the hook modified tracked files outside the original staged pathset, hand back to the user instead of auto-staging unrelated edits. If the retry fails, or if the hook did not modify files, route the hook output back into Step 6 as a fix-loop iteration. Do NOT use `--no-verify`.
4. On success, record the new `HEAD` SHA in `state.completed_phases[*].commit_sha`.

### Step 9 — Handback

At every phase boundary:

1. Print a structured phase summary:
   - Phase label and title
   - Files changed
   - Spawn strategy (parallel | sequential)
   - Test result (passed | skipped-with-warning)
   - Iterations used
   - Mid-phase reviewer findings if any
   - Any warnings (rogue commit, missing test command, skipped tests)
2. Print the literal next command, on its own line:
   ```
   Run: /conduct --resume <plan-path>
   ```
3. Set `state.status = "awaiting_user"`, persist, release lock, exit the skill.

No keyword heuristic watches for "proceed" — the user copies the printed command when ready.

## Fallbacks

- Missing `Impl files:` / `Test files:` → sequential spawn (Step 2).
- Missing `Test command:`, no repo default, no `--test-cmd` → warn, skip tests for the phase, flag in handback summary (Step 5).
- Missing every contract slot across every unfinished phase → continue, but emit the degraded-mode warning on the first handback (phase parsing + Step 9).
- Missing Testing Notes entirely → same as above; phase completes on implementer-only success with the skip flag.
- Delegated subagents unavailable → hard-stop with the explicit delegation-unavailable message above. Do not inline the phase in the main session.
- Plan has zero unfinished phases → print `All phases complete` and exit.

## State File

Path: `<repo-root>/.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json`, where `plan-id` is the basename plus a short hash of the repo-relative plan path. `.conduct/` is git-ignored (Phase 5).

Schema:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "plan_path": "docs/dev_plans/20260422-feature-conduct-skill.md",
  "plan_content_hash": "<sha1 of plan with marker stripped>",
  "base_sha": "<git sha before phase 1>",
  "resume_base_sha": "<git sha at the start of this --resume invocation; absent on first run>",
  "phase_index": 3,
  "current_phase_title": "...",
  "completed_phases": [
    { "index": 1, "label": "1", "title": "...", "commit_sha": "...", "tests": "passed", "iterations": 1 }
  ],
  "last_summary": "...",
  "iteration_count": 0,
  "status": "awaiting_user | running | paused | blocked | schema_error | complete",
  "blocker": null,
  "paused_stash_rev": "<stash commit sha recorded by --pause-phase, or null>"
}
```

### Locking

- Primary: `lock.py` acquires `fcntl.flock` on `<state-file>.lock` fd.
- Fallback if Python is unavailable: atomic `mkdir <state-file>.lockdir`.
- Flock-backed lockfiles are never broken by age alone. For the fallback `mkdir` lockdir path, stale lockdirs older than 1 hour are broken only when the recorded pid is missing or dead.
- `flock(1)` is NOT used — unavailable by default on macOS.
- Two `/conduct` invocations on the same plan in the same worktree race on the same lock. Sibling worktrees resolve to distinct repo-roots via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and therefore distinct state files.

## Trust Boundary

**The plan's `Test command:` and `Validation cmd:` slots are executed as shell commands** (via `runner.run_tests` with `shell=True`). Running `/conduct` on a plan is therefore equivalent in trust to running `make test`, `npm test`, or `cargo test` on a branch you checked out — the plan author chooses what gets executed.

Treat a dev plan received from someone else (a teammate's branch, an external PR, a forwarded file) the same way you'd treat a `Makefile` or `package.json` from that source: read it before running. Preflight validates the review marker to confirm the plan hasn't drifted since it was reviewed, but the marker is a content hash, not a cryptographic signature of the reviewer — it does not attest that anyone trustworthy approved the command.

If you need a stronger guarantee, review the phase `Test command:` and `Validation cmd:` lines before running `/conduct`, or override with `--test-cmd <your-own-cmd>` to ignore the test slot entirely.

## Known Limitations

- **No hard worker wall-clock timeout.** `wait_agent` lets the conductor stop waiting, but it does not provide a portable kill-on-timeout primitive for delegated workers. Mitigated by the fix-loop cap plus explicit iteration counts in prompts. Test-runner timeout is real because the test command is a subprocess.
- **Rogue commits are detected, not prevented.** Subagents are instructed to stage only; a subagent that runs `git commit` anyway is caught by the HEAD-comparison check in Step 8, flagged in state, and handed back to the user rather than auto-corrected.
- **Schema errors do not retry.** A subagent that emits malformed JSON triggers `schema_error` status and immediate handback. The user decides whether to adjust the prompt template or re-invoke.

## Integration Points

- **Plan format**: `/dev-plan` owns the template. Phases need `**Impl files:**`, `**Test files:**`, and `` **Test command:** `<cmd>` `` slots in the contract section above the marker; `**Validation cmd:**` is optional for post-test checks that should hand back on failure. Per-phase progress lives in a `## Progress` section below the marker.
- **Review marker**: `/review-plan` writes the marker line after user acceptance. The marker divides the plan into immutable contract (above, hashed) and editable workspace (below, not hashed). This skill consumes the marker as the readiness signal.
- **Fan-out**: a `/fan-out`-spawned Codex session may invoke `/conduct` as its top-level skill; `/conduct` itself does not fan out.
