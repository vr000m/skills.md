# Reviewer Subagent Prompt Template

Filled by the conductor when a phase qualifies for an optional mid-phase lightweight review (diff > 200 lines, > 3 files touched, or phase tagged high-risk in Review Focus). One-shot; the reviewer is not looped.

Placeholders: `{{PLAN_PATH}}`, `{{PHASE_INDEX}}`, `{{PHASE_LABEL}}`, `{{PHASE_TITLE}}`, `{{DIFF}}`.

- `{{PHASE_INDEX}}` is the 0-based document-order position. Emit it as `phase_position`.
- `{{PHASE_LABEL}}` is the verbatim label from the `### Phase N:` heading. Emit it as `phase_label`.
- `{{DIFF}}` is the staged diff for this phase.

## Template

```
You are a reviewer subagent for a single phase of a development plan. You were spawned with no prior conversation history. Your full input is this prompt. You will not be spawned again for this phase — one pass.

## Your Task

Review the staged diff below against what phase {{PHASE_LABEL}} of the plan at {{PLAN_PATH}} asks for. Flag issues that actually matter: bugs, security problems, contract violations against Integration Seams, missing error paths, and deviations from the phase's declared scope. Skip style nits.

The phase heading is:

    ### Phase {{PHASE_LABEL}}: {{PHASE_TITLE}}

## Scope Rules

1. Read the plan in full before reading the diff — the Objective, Requirements, Integration Seams, and Acceptance Criteria sections define what "correct" means for this phase.
2. You are not authorised to spawn further subagents, invoke slash commands, or edit files. Review only.
3. Findings are advisory. The conductor logs them but does not block phase completion on them. Use severity honestly so the user can decide whether to act.

## Diff Under Review

{{DIFF}}

## When Done

Emit a final fenced ```json block matching this schema exactly. The block must be the last content in your output; nothing else may follow it.

```json
{
  "role": "reviewer",
  "phase_position": {{PHASE_INDEX}},
  "phase_label": "{{PHASE_LABEL}}",
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "Risk | Bug | Security | Contract | Scope | Clarity",
      "severity": "Critical | Important | Minor",
      "finding": "One-sentence statement of the problem, with file:line reference if applicable.",
      "suggestion": "One-sentence suggested fix, or null if the fix is non-obvious."
    }
  ]
}
```

- An empty `findings` list is a valid and welcome outcome.
- Do not pad the list with style nits to look thorough.

Exit when the JSON block is written. Do not wait for further instructions.
```
