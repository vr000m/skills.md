# Content Creation Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for creating blog content and other written materials for the website.

## Blog Writing Guidelines

### Overview

Blog posts target engineers and product managers, explaining complex topics simply without sacrificing technical accuracy. The writing should be clear, direct, and authoritative while remaining accessible.

### Writing Style

- **British English**: Use British spellings in content (e.g., 'optimise', 'realise', 'behaviour')
- **American English for URLs**: Use American spellings in slugs and filenames for SEO (e.g., `optimization` not `optimisation`). Most search traffic uses American spellings.
- **Oxford comma**: Always use the Oxford comma in lists
- **Direct and concise**: Use simple declarative sentences. Avoid:
  - Flowery language and purple prose
  - Unnecessary superlatives ("amazing", "incredible", "revolutionary")
  - Excessive adverbs ("really", "very", "extremely")
  - Superfluous words and filler phrases
  - **Comma splices**: Never join two independent clauses with just a comma. Use a full stop, semicolon, or em dash. Wrong: "The model is fast, it runs locally." Right: "The model is fast. It runs locally." or "The model is fast — it runs locally."
- **Proofread for missing words and typos**: Check for dropped articles (a/an/the), missing subjects ("and have a few days off" → "and I have a few days off"), missing relative pronouns ("a format contains" → "a format that contains"), and incorrect verb forms after auxiliaries ("started traverse" → "started traversing"). Also check for sentence fragments: subordinate clauses ("Which means...", "Because the...") that start a new sentence but lack an independent clause. Either join them to the previous sentence or rephrase with a proper subject ("This means..."). Parenthetical asides within a sentence start with a lowercase letter: "it takes ~300 ms (in pipecat, the timestamps from...)". Also run a spellcheck pass — common quick-draft errors include transposed letters ("avoding" → "avoiding"), dropped characters ("woktrees" → "worktrees"), and stray spaces in compound terms ("X- SIP" → "X-SIP")
- **No repetition**: Avoid repeating statements or concepts unless explicitly for emphasis or to improve readability in complex arguments. Within a single post, do not present the same information twice in different forms (e.g., a bullet summary and then a detailed section covering the same items) — pick one treatment and commit to it
- **Expand acronyms on first use**: Write "VAD (Voice Activity Detection)" on the first occurrence. Well-known acronyms in the target audience's domain (e.g., STT, LLM, API) may be left unexpanded
- **No duplicate links**: Do not link the same URL twice in the same paragraph. Link it once with the most descriptive anchor text and refer to it in plain text thereafter
- **Active voice**: Prefer active voice over passive voice
- **Personal perspective**: Use first-person narrative where appropriate ("I think", "we observed") to create connection
- **Avoid lists in body**: Do not use bullet points or numbered lists in the main body unless they improve clarity for procedural content. Lists should only appear:
  - In the introduction when outlining topics to be covered
  - At the end for concise summaries or key takeaways
  - **Tutorial/procedure exception**: For step-by-step instructions, short numbered lists are allowed in the body. Keep each step concise and support with prose where needed.
  - **TIL exception (selective)**: If a TIL is explicitly a collection of distinct, unrelated ideas, a short bullet list is allowed in the body. Keep it brief, add a one-sentence intro, and avoid lists when the content can be expressed as short paragraphs.
  - Use flowing prose and paragraphs for all other content

### Structure Requirements

Note: TILs (Today I Learned posts) are exempt from the TL;DR and hero image requirements because they should be short. However, TILs still require a forward-looking close (even a single sentence) and should not end abruptly on a bullet list, bare code block, or bare link.

1. **TL;DR**: Start every post with a bolded `**TL;DR:**` that summarises the key message in 1-2 sentences
2. **Hero image**: Include a social media-optimised image after the TL;DR
3. **Hook**: Open with an engaging paragraph that sets context or presents a problem. Avoid cramming multiple links, product names, and technical details into the first paragraph — keep the opener focused and split dense information into subsequent paragraphs
4. **Headings**: Use H2 (`##`) for main sections and H3 (`###`) for subsections
5. **Code blocks**: Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers:
   ```typescript
   // Example code here
   ```
   When referencing technical terms inline, wrap them in backticks: HTML elements (`<track>`, `<video>`), filenames (`.gitignore`, `package.json`), CLI commands (`git worktree`), function names (`parseAuthParams`), environment variables (`NODE_ENV`), and config keys.
6. **Code-prose consistency**: When code examples use specific variable names, prefixes, or identifiers, the surrounding prose must reference them identically. Don't use `X-ft-*` in code and `X-ph-*` in the paragraph that explains it. After editing code, re-read the prose to catch stale references.
   - **Cross-block consistency**: When multiple code blocks form a single workflow, identifiers (labels, filenames, usernames, paths) must match across all blocks. A plist Label must match the string used in `launchctl` commands; a filename created in one snippet must be the filename referenced in the next. After finishing a draft, scan all code blocks as a group to verify shared identifiers agree.
7. **Code example completeness**: Code examples should be self-contained or explicitly mark what's been omitted (e.g., `// parseAuthParams omitted for brevity`). Don't reference functions that appear nowhere in the post. Also ensure code comments stay accurate after refactoring — stale comments that describe removed logic are misleading.
8. **Consistent command syntax**: When referencing a CLI tool or command, use the same invocation form throughout the post. Do not mix slash commands (`/fan-out`) with script paths (`./fan-out`) or other forms — pick one and stick with it
9. **Length**: Default target is 800-1,500 words. Content-type ranges below can override this when justified.

### Content Approach

1. **Layered explanations**: Introduce complex topics progressively:
   - High-level concept introduction
   - Detailed technical explanation
   - Practical examples or use cases
   - Real-world implications

2. **Use analogies**: Connect new concepts to familiar technical concepts (e.g., comparing AI reliability to TCP/UDP networking)

3. **Concrete examples**: Ground abstract concepts with:
   - Real company names and products
   - Actual code snippets
   - Personal anecdotes where relevant
   - Specific metrics and benchmarks

4. **Problem-solution narrative**: Structure posts to:
   - Present a relatable problem
   - Explore underlying issues
   - Present solutions or insights
   - Conclude with forward-looking implications

5. **Show the result**: Don't just describe the process — tell the reader what the outcome was. Did it work? What did it feel like? Was it good, surprising, or disappointing? The payoff is what makes the reader care.

6. **Deliver on the title**: The body must fulfil the promise the title makes. If the title says "in under 5 minutes," the text must address the timing. If it says "remote voice conversations," open with a scenario that demonstrates it. For TILs especially, re-check the title after finishing the draft — TIL titles are often written first and drift from the final content

7. **Include rough edges**: Mention limitations, caveats, or things that didn't work. All-positive write-ups read as promotional. Candour about what's broken or incomplete builds credibility.

8. **Give your best lines room to breathe**: Strong analogies and memorable phrases ("think karaoke for voice cloning") deserve their own sentence or short paragraph. Don't bury them mid-paragraph where they're easy to miss.

9. **Attribute references**: Blockquotes, statistics, and technical claims from external sources must link to the source. Don't leave quotes floating without attribution.

### Technical Requirements

- **Markdown output**: All blog posts must be in Markdown format
- **Frontmatter**: Use the following YAML format:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: 'Your Blog Title Here'
  slug: 'url-slug-for-the-post'
  excerpt: 'A brief description of the post for SEO and social sharing'
  published_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  status: 'published'
  category: 'Industry' | 'Engineering'
  tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']
  authors: ['Varun Singh']
  ---
  ```
- **TIL frontmatter**: TILs use a simpler format:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: 'Your TIL Title Here'
  published_date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  status: 'published'
  audio_url: /static/audio/til/{tag}/{slug}.aac   # optional
  ---
  ```
- **Post-publication updates**: When appending new information to a published post, use a bold label with the year-month: `**Updated (YYYY-MM)**: …`. Place updates at the end of the post, before any closing/forward-looking sentence. Keep updates self-contained — a reader skimming should understand the update without re-reading the whole post
- **Images**: Store source hero-image PNGs in `/images/wip/`. Generated/optimised social images are stored in `/images/blog/YYYY/`
- **File naming**: Use kebab-case for filenames matching the URL slug

### Before Writing

Always ask for clarification on:

1. The specific technical audience (e.g., frontend engineers, DevOps, product managers)
2. The desired depth of technical detail
3. Any specific technologies or frameworks to reference
4. Whether code examples should be included
5. If the topic requires multiple parts

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] Acronyms expanded on first use (except well-known: STT, LLM, API)
- [ ] No duplicate links (same URL linked twice in the same paragraph)
- [ ] Does not end abruptly on a bare code block, bullet list, or link
- [ ] Ends with a forward-looking close (even a single sentence)
- [ ] Post-publication updates use `**Updated (YYYY-MM)**:` format
