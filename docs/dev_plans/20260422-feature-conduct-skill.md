# Task: `conduct` skill — phased delegation for linear implementation

**Status**: Phases 1–8 landed on `feature/conduct-skill`; post-review hardening applied on-branch
**Assigned to**: Claude/Codex (harness-specific implementation), user (review gates)
**Priority**: Medium
**Branch**: `feature/conduct-skill`
**Created**: 2026-04-22
**Completed**: 2026-04-22 (full branch implementation landed; review follow-up patched same day)

## Objective

Add `/conduct` as a phase-by-phase implementation workflow that can be incarnated per harness. The main orchestrator stays thin — only reading structured worker reports, routing failures, running tests, and handing back between phases — so that context does not exhaust during multi-phase execution.

## Context

Users hit a recurring pattern: implementation starts, context fills at ~15–20 %, the agent emits a handoff prompt, the user `/compact`s or `/clear`s, and the next session restarts cold. The heavy reading and editing should not live in the main thread. `fan-out` already parallelises *independent* tasks across worktrees; the gap is the common case — a linear multi-phase plan where phases depend on each other but within a phase the work is small. `/conduct` fills that gap by spawning one implementer + one test-writer per phase with clean context, looping on failure, and pausing at phase boundaries for user-initiated review or manual testing.

This workflow is shared, but the executor is harness-specific. Claude's implementation uses the `Agent` tool. Codex can implement the same pattern with `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent` rather than by mirroring Claude text verbatim. The skill trees are adapted versions, not forced line-by-line mirrors; parity matters where contracts cross harnesses.

This plan was shaped by three `/review-plan` cycles. v1 → v2 resolved worktree-isolation, codex-mirror, intra-phase fan-out, depth-invariant framing. v2 → v3 resolved fix-loop classifier, file-overlap heuristic, test-command format, handback signalling, stale-marker detection, subagent report schema, timeouts, commit-hook recovery, self-host bootstrapping. v3 → v4 (current) resolves the `/review-plan` contract conflict, macOS `flock` availability, hash-strip regex safety, retry-with-clean-context paradox, aspirational timeouts, stage-only enforcement, and Phase 1 verification circularity.

**Implementation ownership.** Phases 1–7 describe the Claude-first implementation and documentation pass. Phase 8 adds the Codex incarnation plus any shared-contract cleanup needed so plans authored/reviewed in either harness can participate in the same `/conduct` workflow.

## Requirements

### Invocation contract

- `/conduct` is invoked directly by the user as a top-level skill, OR inside a harness-specific `fan-out`-spawned subprocess/session. It is NEVER invoked as a worker subagent. The subprocess/session boundary re-baselines depth, so `fan-out → conduct → {implementer, test-writer}` is allowed.
- Delegation depth from a `/conduct` invocation is 1: conduct → workers. Workers never spawn.
- Intra-phase fan-out is explicitly out of scope. If a phase needs parallelism, split it or invoke `/fan-out` at the outer layer.

### Cross-skill impact

- `/review-plan` is impacted wherever plans reviewed in that harness are expected to be `/conduct`-ready. Marker semantics are a producer-side contract, not a Claude-only implementation detail.
- `/dev-plan` is impacted wherever plans authored in that harness are expected to feed `/conduct`. The per-phase `Impl files:` / `Test files:` / `Test command:` slots are shared plan structure, not a Claude-only template flourish.
- `/fan-out` is impacted only at the workflow/docs layer. It should mention `/conduct` only for harnesses where spawning a top-level conductor session is a supported pattern.
- `/deep-review` is not directly coupled to `.conduct` runtime state. It remains diff- and `Review Focus`-driven; only docs/examples need changes if they describe `/conduct` as part of the recommended workflow.
- `AGENTS.md` is impacted because the repo-level workflow should describe `/conduct` as a harness-specific incarnation with shared plan contracts, not as a Claude-only exception or a forced mirror.

### Codex incarnation

- Codex `/conduct` preserves the same phase-by-phase state machine, report schemas, state-file shape, and handback semantics as Claude `/conduct`.
- The Codex main harness uses `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent` to run implementer, test-writer, and optional reviewer workers with clean context.
- The Codex incarnation adapts to Codex harness constraints instead of copying Claude's `Agent`-tool wording. Prompt contracts and state semantics stay aligned; worker-control instructions are Codex-native.
- If a Codex runtime lacks delegated subagents, Phase 8 must choose and document one policy explicitly: either degrade to sequential main-session execution using the same prompt/report contract, or hard-stop with a clear "delegation unavailable" message. Do not silently change behaviour.

### Preflight

- Accepts a path to a dev-plan file. If no arg, scan `docs/dev_plans/` for most-recent `.md` by mtime.
- Reads the plan and looks for a **review marker footer**, which MUST be the final non-empty line of the file, matching regex `^<!-- reviewed: \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} @ [0-9a-f]{40} -->\s*$`. Only the final line is checked; marker-shaped text anywhere else in the plan (e.g., inside prose or code fences documenting the format) is ignored. Written by `/review-plan` after the user accepts findings (Phase 1).
- `<plan-content-hash>` is `git hash-object <tmpfile>` where `<tmpfile>` is the plan with its final line removed if that final line matched the marker regex (otherwise the plan as-is). This makes hashing idempotent and deterministic.
- **Stale-marker check**: recompute the hash per the rule above and compare to the marker's recorded hash; mismatch → treat as unreviewed.
- **Pre-commit health check**: run the repo's pre-commit / lint in non-fix mode on the unchanged tree (`pre-commit run --all-files`, or fall back to `make lint`/`npm run lint`/`ruff check .` per repo idiom, or skip if none). If it already fails, hard-stop with `Tree has pre-existing lint/hook failures; fix them before running /conduct` — this prevents subagent fix-loops chasing issues they didn't introduce.
- If marker absent or stale: hard-stop with `Run: /review-plan <plan-path>` and exit.
- Load `<repo-root>/.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json` if present, where `plan-id` is the basename plus a short hash of the repo-relative plan path. Support `--resume`, `--status`, `--abort-run`, `--pause-phase` (see Abort semantics).
- Parse phases from `## Implementation Checklist` using regex: `^###\s+Phase\s+(\S+)\s*:\s*(.+?)\s*(\([^)]*\))?\s*$` (captures phase label + title, handles colons in title tail, strips parenthesised annotations). Skip phases whose task checkboxes are all `- [x]`. Order by document position; record both the document position (0-based) and the Phase label verbatim.

### Per-phase workflow

For each unfinished phase:

1. **Parse phase contract** from the phase block. Expected slots (added to dev-plan template in Phase 5):
   - `Impl files:` — comma-separated list of likely implementation file paths (globs allowed)
   - `Test files:` — comma-separated list of likely test file paths (globs allowed)
   - ``Test command: `<cmd>` `` — single canonical test invocation for this phase
   - Any of these may be absent; conductor falls back as documented in §"Fallbacks" below.

2. **Parallel vs sequential decision.** If `Impl files:` and `Test files:` resolve to disjoint paths → parallel. If they overlap (same file, or one is a subpath of the other) → sequential (implementer first). If either slot is missing → default sequential. Log the decision in the phase summary.

3. **Spawn subagents** via the harness-native worker API. Claude uses the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: general-purpose`; Codex uses `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent`. Shared workspace. Each gets a filled prompt template — no parent conversation history is passed. Wall-clock timeouts for workers are harness-dependent; where the worker API does not expose a PID or timeout control, document that limitation and rely on the bounded fix loop + explicit iteration count in prompts.

4. **Await both.** Each subagent MUST emit a final fenced ` ```json ` block matching the schema below. If the report is malformed, the conductor hands back with a `schema_error` status in state — no retry. A clean-context respawn cannot meaningfully consume "your output didn't match schema" because the new subagent has no memory of the prior attempt. The user decides whether to re-run `/conduct --resume` or adjust the prompt. If a worker explicitly reports `flags.blocked = true`, or a test-writer reports `needs_impl_clarification`, the conductor persists `state.status = "blocked"` and hands back before tests or commit.

5. **Run tests.** Resolve test command in this order:
   - `--test-cmd` CLI flag
   - Phase's `**Test command:**` line (parser regex: `^\*\*Test command:\*\*\s+\x60([^\x60]+)\x60\s*$`; first match in the phase block wins; additional matches emit a warning and are ignored; case-sensitive; backticks required)
   - Repo default from `package.json` scripts.test, `pyproject.toml` `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, or `Makefile` `test` target
   - If none: warn, skip tests for this phase, flag in state and handback message.

   Test runner wall-clock is enforced via the Python-native runner's dedicated subprocess session and process-group kill path: default 5 min, override via `--test-timeout`. Enforcement is real because the test runner is a subprocess; this differs from the worker-timeout note above.

6. **Fix loop, bounded at N=3** (override `--max-iterations`). **No classifier.** On failure:
   - Pass full test-runner output + prior diff + iteration count to a respawned implementer.
   - Implementer's JSON report includes a flag `test_contract_mismatch: bool` with optional `explanation`.
   - If the respawned implementer sets `test_contract_mismatch: true`, conductor instead respawns the test-writer with the same failures on the next iteration.
   - Iteration count persists to state file after each attempt (crash recovery).
   - Pre-commit hook failures on the phase boundary commit (step 8) count as fix-loop iterations, routed to implementer with the hook output in place of test failures.
   - On cap reached: hand back with blocker message `Phase N stalled after 3 iterations; see .conduct/state-<plan-id>.json for diff and failure history.` Do not auto-advance.

7. **Optional mid-phase lightweight review.** Conductor MAY spawn a single reviewer subagent (never `/deep-review`) when diff > 200 lines, > 3 files touched, or phase tagged high-risk in Review Focus. One-shot, not looped. Reviewer's findings are logged but do not block phase completion.

8. **Commit at phase boundary.** After tests pass:
   - **Rogue-commit check.** Compare `git rev-parse HEAD` to `base_sha` from state (or phase-start SHA). If HEAD advanced, a subagent committed despite the prompt directive; conductor does NOT stack another commit — instead, annotate state with `rogue_commit_sha` and proceed to handback with a warning. This is a prompt-compliance signal, not a hard failure.
   - Otherwise: conductor runs `git commit -m "conduct: phase N — <phase title>"`. Commit author = current git user (no impersonation).
   - If the pre-commit hook fails, route to fix loop (step 6). Do NOT use `--no-verify`.
   - Record commit SHA in state file.

9. **Pause for handback.** Conductor:
   - Prints structured phase summary: files changed, tests passed, mid-review findings if any.
   - Prints literal next command the user can paste: `Run: /conduct --resume <plan-path>`.
   - Persists state (marked `awaiting_user` with last commit SHA).
   - Exits the skill. No keyword heuristic; user runs the printed command when ready.

### State file

`<repo-root>/.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json`, where `plan-id` is the basename plus a short hash of the repo-relative plan path. Repo-root resolved via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. `.conduct/` added to `.gitignore`.

Schema:

```json
{
  "plan_path": "docs/dev_plans/...",
  "plan_content_hash": "<sha1 of plan with marker stripped>",
  "base_sha": "<git sha before phase 1>",
  "resume_base_sha": "<git sha at the start of this --resume invocation; absent on first run>",
  "phase_index": 3,
  "current_phase_title": "...",
  "completed_phases": [
    { "index": 1, "label": "1", "title": "...", "commit_sha": "...", "tests": "passed", "iterations": 1 }
  ],
  "last_summary": "...",
  "iteration_count": 0,
  "status": "awaiting_user | running | paused | blocked | schema_error | complete",
  "blocker": null
}
```

**Lockfile**: conductor acquires an advisory lock on `.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json.lock` before writing. Primary mechanism is a small Python helper (`conduct/lock.py`) that uses `fcntl.flock` on the lockfile fd — portable across macOS and Linux without extra tooling. Fallback if Python is unavailable: atomic `mkdir` lockdir. Stale fallback lockdirs older than 1 h are broken only when their recorded pid is gone. `flock(1)` is NOT used — it is not present by default on macOS. Two `/conduct` invocations on the same plan in the same worktree race on the same lock; across sibling worktrees each has its own state file (distinct `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`).

### Abort semantics

Naming is chosen so the more-destructive flag has the more-explicit name.

- `/conduct --pause-phase <plan>` → `git stash push -u -m "conduct-pause-phase-<N>"` to capture any uncommitted work, mark phase as "user-paused" in state (state lives; `--resume` can pick up), exit. User decides whether to drop or pop the stash. Does NOT run `git reset --hard` or `git clean`.
- `/conduct --abort-run <plan>` → discard state file entirely, no git operations, no stash. State dies; next `/conduct` starts fresh.
- Usage message prints both flags side-by-side with a one-line disambiguation.

### Subagent report schemas

All reports use two distinct phase identifiers:
- `phase_position`: 0-based index by document order (what conductor uses internally)
- `phase_label`: verbatim label from the `### Phase N:` heading (what humans read)

**Implementer** final ` ```json ` block:

```json
{
  "role": "implementer",
  "phase_position": 0,
  "phase_label": "1",
  "iteration": 0,
  "files_changed": ["src/foo.py", "src/bar.py"],
  "summary": "One-paragraph human-readable summary",
  "flags": {
    "blocked": false,
    "test_contract_mismatch": false,
    "explanation": null,
    "needs_test_coverage": []
  }
}
```

**Test-writer** final ` ```json ` block:

```json
{
  "role": "test-writer",
  "phase_position": 0,
  "phase_label": "1",
  "iteration": 0,
  "test_files_added": ["tests/test_foo.py"],
  "test_commands": ["pytest tests/test_foo.py -v"],
  "coverage_summary": "Covers acceptance criteria 1–3; gap on error path X",
  "flags": {
    "blocked": false,
    "needs_impl_clarification": null
  }
}
```

**Reviewer** final ` ```json ` block:

```json
{
  "role": "reviewer",
  "phase_position": 0,
  "phase_label": "1",
  "findings": [
    { "category": "Risk", "severity": "Important", "finding": "...", "suggestion": "..." }
  ]
}
```

### Fallbacks

- Missing `Impl files:` / `Test files:` → sequential spawn
- Missing `Test command:` → resolve from repo defaults, then `--test-cmd`, then skip with warning
- Missing Testing Notes entirely → same as above; phase completes on implementer success alone (flagged)

## Review Focus

- **Delegation depth invariant.** No subagent prompt template mentions `/deep-review`, `/fan-out`, `/review-plan`, or any skill that spawns agents. Verified by grep in Phase 6.
- **Context isolation.** Each subagent invocation passes a filled template as the full prompt; no parent conversation threading. Verified by Phase 6 sentinel test.
- **Fix-loop termination.** Hard N=3 cap with graceful handback.
- **Plan-readiness precondition.** Hard-stop on missing or stale marker (content-hash compare).
- **Shared-workspace safety.** Sequential fallback on declared file overlap. Commit-at-boundary only.
- **Self-host bootstrap.** Phase 6 includes explicit steps to acquire a real marker on this plan after Phase 1 ships.

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: `/review-plan` writes the review marker

**Impl files:** `.claude/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md`
**Test files:** none (manual verification)
**Test command:** none (manual)

- [x] **Resolve contract conflict first.** `review-plan/SKILL.md:142,151` currently says "Do NOT modify the plan automatically" / "Never modify the plan file directly." Rewrite both lines to carve out the marker footer: "Never modify the plan *body* automatically; findings drive a conversation. The sole exception is the review marker footer — a single trailing comment line appended after the user explicitly accepts or waives findings."
- [x] After the findings-presentation step, add a prompt: "Are findings addressed (yes/waive/no)?"
- [x] On `yes` or `waive`: compute the plan hash per the rule in `/conduct` Preflight (strip only the final line if it matches the marker regex, then `git hash-object`), append or replace the final line with `<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD @ <hash> -->`.
- [x] On `no`: exit without writing.
- [x] Document marker format, hash-computation rule, and "final line only" semantics in `review-plan/SKILL.md`.
- [x] Phase 1 manual verification (this phase only): run `/review-plan` on a scratch plan, answer `yes`, confirm the marker line is appended as the final line and has the expected format. Edit the plan body (non-marker line), re-run `/review-plan`, answer `yes`, confirm marker is replaced (not duplicated) and hash updated. Stale-detection verification is deferred to Phase 6 because it requires `/conduct` preflight.

### Phase 2: `/dev-plan` template extension

**Impl files:** `.claude/skills/dev-plan/template.md`, `.claude/skills/dev-plan/SKILL.md`
**Test files:** none
**Test command:** none

- [x] Extend template Phase sections with three optional slots immediately under each `### Phase N:` heading: `**Impl files:**`, `**Test files:**`, ``**Test command:** `<cmd>` ``
- [x] Update `dev-plan/SKILL.md` to explain these slots and when to fill them (omit when trivially inferable; required for `/conduct`-driven phases)
- [x] Update this plan (20260422-feature-conduct-skill.md) to include the slots for its own phases (already done in this v3 draft — verify)

### Phase 3: Conduct skill scaffolding

**Impl files:** `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/conduct/implementer-prompt.md`, `.claude/skills/conduct/test-writer-prompt.md`, `.claude/skills/conduct/reviewer-prompt.md`
**Test files:** none (templates are verified in Phase 6)
**Test command:** `grep -E '/(deep-review|fan-out|review-plan|conduct)' .claude/skills/conduct/*.md && echo FAIL || echo OK`

- [x] Create `.claude/skills/conduct/` directory
- [x] Write `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (name, description, trigger phrases: "step through plan", "walk phases", "delegate phase implementation", "conduct plan", "run the plan") and the workflow body from the Requirements section
- [x] Write `implementer-prompt.md` template with placeholders `{{PLAN_PATH}}`, `{{PHASE_INDEX}}`, `{{PHASE_TITLE}}`, `{{PRIOR_DIFF}}`, `{{TEST_FAILURES}}`, `{{ITERATION}}`, `{{BASE_SHA}}`. Includes: "do not invoke slash commands or skills"; "stage with `git add`, do not commit"; final JSON report schema
- [x] Write `test-writer-prompt.md` template with placeholders `{{PLAN_PATH}}`, `{{PHASE_INDEX}}`, `{{PHASE_TITLE}}`, `{{EXISTING_TESTS}}`, `{{BASE_SHA}}`. Same directives + test-writer JSON schema
- [x] Write `reviewer-prompt.md` template with placeholders `{{PLAN_PATH}}`, `{{PHASE_INDEX}}`, `{{DIFF}}`. One-shot, reviewer JSON schema
- [x] Verify: run the `grep` test command above to confirm no prompt references skill-spawning slash commands

### Phase 4: Conductor logic in SKILL.md

**Impl files:** `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`
**Test files:** none (manual verification)
**Test command:** none (Phase 6 exercises this)

- [x] Document preflight algorithm: plan path resolution, marker read + stale check (hash recompute), phase parsing regex, state-file load
- [x] Document per-phase workflow (steps 1–9 from Requirements) including the parallel-vs-sequential heuristic, subagent spawn, JSON report parse-or-retry-once, fix loop N=3, pre-commit-hook-as-iteration routing, boundary commit, handback message with literal `Run: /conduct --resume` line
- [x] Document pause/abort semantics (`--pause-phase` = stash; `--abort-run` = drop state)
- [x] Document timeouts and CLI flags (`--test-timeout`, `--max-iterations`, `--test-cmd`, `--resume`, `--status`, `--pause-phase`, `--abort-run`)

### Phase 5: State file + lockfile

**Impl files:** `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md` (algorithm), `.claude/skills/conduct/parser.py`, `.claude/skills/conduct/marker.py`, `.claude/skills/conduct/lock.py`, `.claude/skills/conduct/tests/` (deterministic tests — see below), `.gitignore`
**Test files:** `.claude/skills/conduct/tests/test_parser.py`, `.claude/skills/conduct/tests/test_marker.py`, `.claude/skills/conduct/tests/test_state.py`, `.claude/skills/conduct/tests/test_skill_spawn_grep.sh`
**Test command:** `uvx pytest .claude/skills/conduct/tests/ -v && bash .claude/skills/conduct/tests/test_skill_spawn_grep.sh`

**Test deps**: pytest is invoked through `uvx` so no project-level install is required. Stock `python3 -m pytest` only works if the user has pytest installed system-wide; `uvx` is the documented invocation.

- [x] Document state file schema in `SKILL.md` exactly as specified in Requirements §"State file"
- [x] Document path resolution: `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.conduct/state-$(basename <plan>).json`
- [x] Write `lock.py` helper: `fcntl.flock` on lockfile fd; 1 h stale-break rule; atomic `mkdir` fallback if Python is unavailable
- [x] Add `.conduct/` to `.gitignore`
- [x] Write `tests/test_parser.py`: phase regex on synthetic headings (colons, parens, non-contiguous numbering, already-completed phases); `Test command:` regex (backticks, multiple matches, malformed)
- [x] Write `tests/test_marker.py`: hash-strip idempotency (marker in final line strips; marker-shaped lines in body do NOT strip); round-trip through append-or-replace
- [x] Write `tests/test_state.py`: state-file schema round-trip; lockfile acquisition/release; stale-lock break
- [x] Write `tests/test_skill_spawn_grep.sh`: greps `.claude/skills/conduct/*.md` for skill-spawn phrases (`/deep-review`, `/fan-out`, `/review-plan`) used as actions — exits non-zero on any match outside a designated allow-list (e.g., "do NOT invoke /deep-review" is allowed prose)

### Phase 6: Manual verification

**Impl files:** none (scratch plans under `/tmp/conduct-verify/`)
**Test files:** scratch test fixtures created per scenario
**Test command:** per scenario

- [x] **Acquire real marker on this plan.** After Phase 1 ships, run `/review-plan docs/dev_plans/20260422-feature-conduct-skill.md`, accept findings, confirm marker footer appears. Verified 2026-04-22: fourth `/review-plan` cycle accepted the Important findings (drift in New Files list, stale `timeout` dep, `abort_run` lockfile cleanup, misleading "re-implement inline" phrasing), marker rewritten by `marker.write_marker` to `12d5caf...`.
- [x] **Happy path.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_happy_path_single_phase_commits_and_hands_back` and `::test_multi_phase_via_resume_advances_one_phase_at_a_time` — stub-spawner harness exercises both subagents passing first try, real `git commit` at boundary, and `--resume` advancing to the next phase.
- [x] **Assertion failure → implementer respawn.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_assertion_failure_respawns_implementer_and_passes_on_iteration_1`. Asserts the conductor reset the index, threaded prior_diff + test_failures into iteration 1, and recorded `iteration_count = 1`.
- [x] **Test contract mismatch → test-writer respawn.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_test_contract_mismatch_routes_iteration_1_to_test_writer`. Implementer iteration-0 report sets `test_contract_mismatch: true`; iteration-1 spawn is the test-writer, not the implementer.
- [x] **Fix-loop cap.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_fix_loop_cap_blocks_after_three_iterations`. Four implementer spawns (iterations 0–3) then `state.status = "blocked"` with the stalled-after-N message.
- [x] **Preflight hard stop.** Covered by `tests/test_preflight.py::test_preflight_rejects_unmarked_plan` — `marker_is_stale` returns the no-marker sentinel, which the conductor maps to the "Run: /review-plan ..." hard stop.
- [x] **Preflight stale marker.** Covered by `tests/test_preflight.py::test_preflight_detects_stale_marker` and `::test_preflight_any_body_change_invalidates_marker[*]`.
- [x] **Marker-in-body safety.** Covered by `tests/test_preflight.py::test_preflight_marker_in_body_does_not_falsely_validate` and `::test_preflight_marker_after_in_body_examples_is_the_one_that_counts`.
- [x] **Pre-existing lint failure.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_preflight_lint_failure_hard_stops_before_any_spawn`. Stub `lint_check` returns a diagnostic; conductor returns `status="preflight_fail"` and never invokes the spawn or test-runner seams.
- [x] **Context isolation.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_context_isolation_no_sentinel_leaks_into_rendered_prompts`. Sentinel set in the parent process env / test scope; rendered prompts (which include every templated placeholder) contain zero hits.
- [x] **File-overlap sequential fallback.** Demonstrated by `tests/test_parser.py::test_files_overlap_*` plus the integration check in `tests/test_preflight.py::test_preflight_parses_phases_with_completion_and_glob_slots`. Conductor's branch on the result is straight-line text in SKILL.md Step 2.
- [x] **Missing test command.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_missing_test_command_warns_and_completes_phase`. No `Test command:` slot, no override; conductor records the skip warning, never calls the test runner, and still commits the phase.
- [x] **Pre-commit hook failure routed to fix loop.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_precommit_hook_failure_routes_to_fix_loop`. Real `.git/hooks/pre-commit` fails attempt 1 and passes attempt 2; conductor counts the failure as `iteration_count = 1`, threads hook output into the next implementer spawn as `test_failures`, and lands the boundary commit on attempt 2.
- [x] **Resume across process restart.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_resume_across_simulated_restart_picks_up_at_next_phase`. Phase 1 completes; the in-memory state object is discarded; a brand-new `ConductOptions` with `resume=True` reads only the on-disk state file and advances to phase 2.
- [x] **Pause phase.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_pause_phase_stashes_and_marks_state`. `pause_phase` runs `git stash push -u -m conduct-pause-phase-<title>`, sets `state.status = "paused"`, exits without touching `git reset`.
- [x] **Abort run.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_abort_run_deletes_state_without_touching_tree`. State file deleted; user's working tree files (incl. uncommitted `scratch.txt`) preserved; no stash created.
- [x] **Rogue-commit detection.** Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_rogue_commit_detection_does_not_stack_a_second_commit`. Stub implementer runs `git commit` mid-spawn; conductor detects HEAD ≠ baseline at Step 8, records `rogue_commit_sha`, sets `commit_sha = None`, and refuses to stack a second commit.
- [x] **Schema error hard-stop.** Covered by `tests/test_schema.py::test_extract_raises_when_no_block`, `::test_parse_report_invalid_json_raises`, and the missing-key / wrong-type / role-mismatch cases. `parse_report` raises `SchemaError`; SKILL.md Step 4 maps every `SchemaError` to `state.status = "schema_error"` + handback (no respawn).
- [x] **Self-host.** Run `/conduct docs/dev_plans/20260422-feature-conduct-skill.md` on itself (after marker acquired in step 1 above). Pure dogfood. Verified 2026-04-22: preflight validated the marker against the current body hash, lint probe correctly skipped (no `pre-commit`/`Makefile`/`package.json`/`pyproject.toml` at repo root — ruff present but not triggered), phase parser identified Phase 6 as the only unfinished phase with no delegable implementer work, conductor wrote `.conduct/state-20260422-feature-conduct-skill.json` and advanced to phase-boundary commit without needing `Agent`-tool spawns.
- [x] **Test-runner timeout.** Covered by `tests/test_runner.py::test_run_tests_timeout_kills_long_command` (sleep 10 with a 0.5s timeout — process killed promptly, `timed_out=True`, returncode `-1`, conductor routes that as a fix-loop failure per SKILL.md Step 6).
- [x] **Phase parsing.** Covered by `tests/test_preflight.py::test_preflight_parses_phases_with_completion_and_glob_slots` (end-to-end on a synthetic plan with annotation, completion, and glob slots) plus the unit-level coverage in `tests/test_parser.py`.

### Phase 7: Claude docs and integration

**Impl files:** `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `.claude/skills/dev-plan/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/fan-out/SKILL.md`
**Test files:** none
**Test command:** none

Phase 7 MUST land before PR regardless of Phase 6 iteration count. This is the Claude-first documentation pass; Phase 8 carries the Codex incarnation and any remaining cross-harness contract cleanup.

- [x] `AGENTS.md`: add `/conduct` to skill index; reword the depth-invariant paragraph to preserve existing vocabulary: "Workers launched in a fresh Claude subprocess (e.g., via `fan-out.sh spawn`) start a new orchestrator/worker tree and may themselves act as orchestrators; the one-level rule applies per-tree."
- [x] `README.md`: during the Claude-first milestone, document `conduct` in the skill matrix and explain the temporary Claude-only rollout path (`CLAUDE_ONLY_SKILLS="conduct"`). Phase 8 removes that temporary exception in the final repo plumbing.
- [x] `.claude/skills/dev-plan/SKILL.md`: add pointer to `/conduct` as the "execute a reviewed plan" companion; mention the per-phase `Impl files:` / `Test files:` / `Test command:` slots
- [x] `.claude/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md`: document the marker footer it writes and that `/conduct` consumes it
- [x] `.claude/skills/fan-out/SKILL.md`: note that a fan-out-spawned subprocess may invoke `/conduct` as its top-level skill; `/conduct` itself does not fan out
- [x] Leave `.codex/skills/` untouched in the Claude-first milestone. Any Codex-side adaptation happens in Phase 8.

### Phase 8: Codex incarnation and shared-contract parity

**Impl files:** `.codex/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`, `.codex/skills/conduct/implementer-prompt.md`, `.codex/skills/conduct/test-writer-prompt.md`, `.codex/skills/conduct/reviewer-prompt.md`, `.codex/skills/conduct/conductor.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/parser.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/marker.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/schema.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/runner.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/lock.py`, `.codex/skills/dev-plan/template.md`, `.codex/skills/dev-plan/SKILL.md`, `.codex/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md`, `.codex/skills/fan-out/SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `.env.example`, `scripts/sync-skills.sh`, `scripts/promote-skills.sh`, `scripts/bootstrap-skills.sh`, `scripts/check-sync.sh`
**Test files:** `.codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_parser.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_marker.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_schema.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_state.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_runner.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_preflight.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_conductor_harness.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_skill_spawn_grep.sh`
**Test command:** `uvx pytest .codex/skills/conduct/tests/ -v && bash .codex/skills/conduct/tests/test_skill_spawn_grep.sh`

- [x] Create `.codex/skills/conduct/` as a Codex-native orchestration skill. Preserve the phase-by-phase conduct model, but adapt worker control to `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent` rather than Claude's `Agent` tool.
- [x] Add Codex-side helper modules (`conductor.py`, `parser.py`, `marker.py`, `schema.py`, `runner.py`, `lock.py`) under `.codex/skills/conduct/`. Do not rely implicitly on `.claude/skills/conduct/` paths at runtime.
- [x] Keep the same plan-readiness contract: Codex `/conduct` consumes the same review marker format, per-phase `Impl files:` / `Test files:` / `Test command:` slots, JSON report schemas, and `.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json` shape as Claude `/conduct`.
- [x] Decide and document the Codex fallback policy when delegated subagents are unavailable in the current runtime: either sequential main-session execution with the same prompt/report contract, or an explicit hard-stop. Do not silently degrade into a different workflow.
- [x] Update `.codex/skills/dev-plan/template.md` and `.codex/skills/dev-plan/SKILL.md` so plans authored in Codex carry the same per-phase slots required by `/conduct`.
- [x] Update `.codex/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md` so a plan reviewed in Codex can become `/conduct`-ready by emitting the same trailing marker footer after user acceptance. If the repo rejects that portability, document the asymmetry explicitly instead of leaving it implicit.
- [x] Update repo skill-distribution plumbing so Codex `conduct` participates in the normal mirror workflow once Phase 8 lands: move `conduct` from `CLAUDE_ONLY_SKILLS` to `MANAGED_SKILLS`, remove the Claude-only defaults, and update `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.env.example`, `scripts/sync-skills.sh`, `scripts/promote-skills.sh`, `scripts/bootstrap-skills.sh`, and `scripts/check-sync.sh` accordingly.
- [x] Update `AGENTS.md` to describe `/conduct` as harness-specific incarnations sharing plan contracts, not as a Claude-only exception and not as a forced verbatim mirror.
- [x] Leave `.codex/skills/deep-review/SKILL.md` functionally unchanged unless workflow docs/examples need to mention `/conduct`; deep-review continues to operate on diffs and `Review Focus`, not `.conduct` state.
- [x] Update `.codex/skills/fan-out/SKILL.md` only if a Codex fan-out spawned session should be allowed to invoke `/conduct` as its top-level skill.
- [x] Add Codex-side deterministic tests for parser/marker/schema/state/runner behaviour, forbidden nested orchestration references, the chosen delegation-availability policy, and the Codex conductor harness.

### Architecture Decisions

- **Delegation depth = 1 per orchestrator tree.** Fan-out's subprocess/session model starts a new tree, so `fan-out → conduct` is valid. AGENTS.md uses the per-tree framing rather than binding the rule to one harness implementation.
- **`/conduct` is a workflow concept with harness-specific incarnations.** Claude and Codex do not need identical text, but they should share the producer/consumer contracts that cross harnesses: review marker semantics, per-phase plan slots, report schema, and state-file shape.
- **Shared workspace, no worktrees.** Worktree isolation is the user's choice at the outer layer. Clean context comes from harness-native worker APIs that do not inherit parent conversation history, not from filesystem separation.
- **Codex worker control is `spawn_agent`-native.** The Codex incarnation keeps the same orchestration pattern while adapting subagent launch, wait, and cleanup to Codex's agent APIs instead of Claude's `Agent` tool.
- **Codex v1 ships its own helper modules.** Parser/marker/schema/state/runner/lock/conductor helpers live under `.codex/skills/conduct/` rather than implicitly importing from `.claude/skills/conduct/`. This keeps each harness self-contained while matching contracts through deterministic tests.
- **No fix-loop classifier.** Always respawn implementer with full runner output; implementer flags `test_contract_mismatch` in JSON report → conductor respawns test-writer next iteration.
- **JSON schema for subagent reports.** Fenced ` ```json ` at end of output. Single attempt — malformed report = hard `schema_error` status + handback, no retry (a clean-context respawn cannot consume a "your last output was bad" preamble).
- **Commit per phase** at the boundary by the conductor. Subagents stage only. Rogue commits by subagents are detected (not corrected) via HEAD-comparison. Pre-commit-hook failure on the boundary commit = fix-loop iteration.
- **Review marker** = `<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD @ <hash> -->` as the final line only; hash = `git hash-object` of plan with final marker line stripped (idempotent on re-review).
- **`/review-plan` owns a carve-out** in its no-modify contract: plan body stays immutable, marker footer is the single exception.
- **State file** at `<repo-root>/.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json` with Python `fcntl.flock` lockfile (NOT `flock(1)` — unavailable on macOS by default).
- **Pre-commit health check at preflight** so fix-loops don't chase pre-existing lint failures.
- **Worker timeout enforcement is harness-dependent.** Claude's `Agent` tool gives no PID, so worker wall-clock enforcement there is not available in v1. Test-runner timeout is real because it is enforced by a normal subprocess wrapper.
- **No keyword handback.** Exit message prints the literal `/conduct --resume <plan>` command; user copies and runs.
- **Abort naming.** `--pause-phase` = stash + keep state (recoverable). `--abort-run` = drop state (destructive). More-destructive flag has the more-explicit name. Neither uses `git reset --hard` or `git clean`.
- **Skill impact is asymmetric.** `/review-plan` and `/dev-plan` are producer-side dependencies of `/conduct` and therefore must change wherever plans need to be portable into `/conduct`. `/deep-review` stays largely independent because it consumes diffs and `Review Focus`, not `.conduct` state.
- **Repo distribution flips only when Phase 8 lands.** Until Codex `conduct` is real, `conduct` stays in `CLAUDE_ONLY_SKILLS`. Phase 8 explicitly migrates it into the mirrored `MANAGED_SKILLS` path and updates docs/scripts in the same change.

### Dependencies

- Claude `Agent` tool for the current implementation. Note: the `Agent` tool provides no PID or timeout lever; agent wall-clock enforcement is therefore a v1 known limitation there.
- Codex `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent` for the Codex incarnation.
- `git` (hash-object, stash, commit, rev-parse)
- `python3` (for `lock.py`, `runner.py`, and friends — ships with macOS and most Linuxes by default; if absent, atomic `mkdir` lockdir fallback)
- Phase 1 (`/review-plan` marker) — blocking prerequisite for `/conduct` to be usable

Note: the earlier GNU `timeout` / `gtimeout` dependency was dropped. `runner.py` uses a Python-native subprocess session with explicit process-group termination, which is portable across macOS and Linux without extra packages.

### Integration Seams

| Seam | Writer | Caller | Contract |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Plan parsing | Claude/Codex `/dev-plan` | `/conduct` | Plan contains `## Implementation Checklist` with `### Phase N: <title>` headings; optional per-phase `**Impl files:**`, `**Test files:**`, ``**Test command:** `<cmd>` `` slots |
| Review marker | Claude/Codex `/review-plan` | `/conduct` | Trailing `<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD @ <hash> -->` footer written after user acceptance; hash = `git hash-object` of plan with marker stripped |
| Implementer contract | `/conduct` | implementer subagent | Filled template as full prompt; final ` ```json ` block with role, files_changed, summary, flags.{blocked, test_contract_mismatch, explanation, needs_test_coverage} |
| Test-writer contract | `/conduct` | test-writer subagent | Filled template as full prompt; final ` ```json ` block with role, test_files_added, test_commands, coverage_summary, flags.{blocked, needs_impl_clarification} |
| Reviewer contract (opt.) | `/conduct` | reviewer subagent | Filled template; final ` ```json ` block with findings list |
| State persistence | `/conduct` | itself (resume) | `<repo-root>/.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json`, schema in Requirements §"State file"; `flock` lockfile |
| Handback | `/conduct` | user | Structured summary + literal `Run: /conduct --resume <plan>` line; skill exits |
| Claude worker orchestration | Claude runtime | `/conduct` | `Agent`-tool workers, no parent conversation history, harness-specific timeout limitations |
| Codex worker orchestration | Codex runtime | `/conduct` | `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent` workers, same report/state contract, Codex-native fallback policy documented in Phase 8 |
| Fan-out subprocess/session | `/fan-out` | `/conduct` | Fan-out may spawn a harness-specific subprocess/session whose top-level skill is `/conduct`; the boundary re-baselines depth |

## Testing Notes

### Test Approach

- Manual verification matrix in Phase 6 covers 16 scenarios spanning happy path, fix-loop branches, preflight, concurrency, abort, and self-host.
- Each scenario uses a scratch plan under `/tmp/conduct-verify/` (not committed) to avoid polluting `docs/dev_plans/`.
- Context-isolation test uses a sentinel string and prompt-capture logging; if the `Agent` tool does not expose prompt logging, add a temporary `echo "$PROMPT" > /tmp/captured-$(date +%s)` step in the spawn helper, remove after verification.

### Edge Cases Tested

Listed in Phase 6 as individual bullets — each edge case has its own checkbox.

## Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Self-hosting bootstrap
- **Problem**: `/conduct` hard-stops without a marker; this plan has none because Phase 1 ships the marker-writer. Chicken-and-egg.
- **Solution**: Phase 6's first verification step is explicitly "acquire a real marker on this plan by running `/review-plan` (after Phase 1 is merged locally) and accept findings." No hand-annotated markers.
- **Files affected**: `docs/dev_plans/20260422-feature-conduct-skill.md` (gets marker appended), Phase 6 checklist

### Issue 2: Fix-loop classifier heterogeneity across test runners
- **Problem**: pytest/jest/mocha/go test format parse errors, assertions, and fixture failures differently. A regex classifier in the conductor would misroute.
- **Solution**: Drop the classifier. Conductor always respawns implementer with the full runner output. Implementer's JSON report flag `test_contract_mismatch: true` re-routes the next iteration to test-writer. The subagent has runner context, the classifier didn't.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/conduct/implementer-prompt.md`

### Issue 3: File-overlap heuristic unrealisable without data
- **Problem**: Conductor can't predict which files a phase touches without reading the subagent's mind.
- **Solution**: Require the plan author to declare `Impl files:` and `Test files:` slots per phase. Conductor compares declared paths, not predicts. Missing slots → sequential fallback (safe default).
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/dev-plan/template.md`, `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 4: Test-command extraction from free-form prose
- **Problem**: Testing Notes is unstructured.
- **Solution**: Canonical ``**Test command:** `<cmd>` `` slot per phase. Fallback chain: phase slot → `--test-cmd` → repo defaults → skip-with-warning.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/dev-plan/template.md`, `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 5: Handback relies on main Claude behaviour not in scope
- **Problem**: No mechanism binds "proceed" to `/conduct --resume`. The skill has exited.
- **Solution**: Exit message prints the literal command. User copies and runs. No keyword heuristic.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 6: Stale marker after plan edit
- **Problem**: A marker dated YYYY-MM-DD survives arbitrary post-review edits.
- **Solution**: Marker records `git hash-object <plan>` computed with marker line stripped. Preflight recomputes; mismatch = stale = hard stop.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 7: Free-form subagent reports
- **Problem**: Conductor can't parse prose reliably for flags, file lists, etc.
- **Solution**: Final ` ```json ` block with pinned schema per role. Parse-or-retry-once, then hard error. Schema documented in this plan and enforced in prompts.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/*-prompt.md`, `SKILL.md`

### Issue 8: Pre-commit hook failure = lost work
- **Problem**: Conductor commits at phase boundary; if a hook fails, what now?
- **Solution**: Hook output replaces "test failures" in the fix-loop input; counts as one iteration; routed to implementer (who owns code quality). No `--no-verify`.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 9: Abort semantics hit the destructive-command deny list
- **Problem**: `git reset --hard` and `git clean` are denied in permissions.
- **Solution**: `--pause-phase` uses `git stash push -u -m "conduct-pause-phase-<N>"`; state lives so `--resume` picks up. `--abort-run` drops state without stashing. User decides to drop any stash.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 10: Missing timeouts leave conductor hung
- **Problem**: Subagent or test-runner hang → conductor waits forever.
- **Solution**: Test-runner wall-clock is enforced via the Python-native runner's dedicated subprocess session plus process-group termination (`--test-timeout` default 5m). Worker-timeout is harness-dependent; Claude's `Agent` tool gives no PID, so that limitation is documented for v1 and mitigated by the fix-loop cap.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 11: `/review-plan` immutability contract conflicts with marker-writing
- **Problem**: `review-plan/SKILL.md:142,151` explicitly forbids modifying the plan file. Phase 1 adds marker-writing.
- **Solution**: Phase 1 rewrites both constraint lines to carve out the marker footer as the single exception: plan body immutable, trailing comment marker allowed after explicit user acceptance.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md`

### Issue 12: `flock(1)` unavailable on macOS by default
- **Problem**: `which flock` fails on default macOS; plan originally claimed "present on Linux and macOS/homebrew" — wrong.
- **Solution**: Python `fcntl.flock` helper (`lock.py`) with atomic `mkdir` lockdir fallback. Python 3 ships with macOS. No dependency on `flock(1)`.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/lock.py`, `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 13: Hash-strip regex collides with marker-shaped text in plan body
- **Problem**: Plans may legitimately contain marker-shaped strings in prose or code fences (this plan does). A naive `grep -v` strips all of them before hashing, breaking the self-host test.
- **Solution**: Strip ONLY the final line if it matches the strict regex `^<!-- reviewed: \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} @ [0-9a-f]{40} -->\s*$`. Body untouched. Verified by Phase 6 marker-in-body scenario + `tests/test_marker.py`.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/conduct/tests/test_marker.py`

### Issue 14: Parse-or-retry-once is meaningless with clean-context subagents
- **Problem**: A fresh subagent respawned with "your output didn't match the schema" prepended has no memory of its prior attempt — the retry is just a duplicate attempt.
- **Solution**: Drop the retry. Malformed JSON → `schema_error` state + handback. User inspects and re-invokes.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 15: Subagents can commit despite prompt directive
- **Problem**: "Stage only" is prompt-level only; nothing prevents a subagent from running `git commit`.
- **Solution**: Conductor compares `HEAD` to `base_sha`/phase-start SHA before its own boundary commit. If HEAD advanced, record `rogue_commit_sha` in state and handback with a warning rather than stacking another commit.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 16: Pre-existing lint failures trigger pointless fix-loops
- **Problem**: Conductor's boundary commit runs pre-commit hooks. If the repo already has lint issues unrelated to the phase's work, phase 1's commit fails and the implementer is asked to fix things it never touched.
- **Solution**: Preflight runs `pre-commit run --all-files` (or repo-idiomatic equivalent) once; hard-stops with a clear diagnostic if the tree is already dirty. Fix-loops only chase issues the subagents actually introduced.
- **Files affected**: `.claude/skills/conduct/SKILL.md`

### Issue 17: Phase 1 verification circular dependency
- **Problem**: Phase 1 verification originally required `/conduct` preflight (stale-detection test) — but `/conduct` doesn't exist until Phase 4.
- **Solution**: Split verification. Phase 1 verifies only "marker appears + idempotent replace." Stale-detection moves to Phase 6 where `/conduct` is available.
- **Files affected**: Phase 1 checklist, Phase 6 checklist

### Issue 18: Treating `conduct` as Claude-only hides producer-skill contract changes
- **Problem**: `conduct` can be implemented differently per harness, but its inputs are still produced by `/dev-plan` and `/review-plan`. Leaving Codex producer skills on older contracts would make Codex-authored plans non-portable into `/conduct` while the repo workflow claims a shared plan pipeline.
- **Solution**: Separate executor concerns from producer contracts. Keep the worker-control implementation harness-specific, but align review-marker semantics and per-phase plan slots wherever plans need to move between Claude and Codex `/conduct`.
- **Files affected**: `.codex/skills/dev-plan/template.md`, `.codex/skills/dev-plan/SKILL.md`, `.codex/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`

### Issue 19: `deep-review` can look coupled to `conduct` even though it is not
- **Problem**: Once `/conduct` becomes part of the recommended workflow, it is easy to overfit `deep-review` to `.conduct` artifacts or phase state.
- **Solution**: Keep `deep-review` focused on diffs and `Review Focus`. Only update docs/examples if they mention `/conduct`; do not create a runtime dependency on `.conduct` state unless a later design explicitly needs it.
- **Files affected**: `AGENTS.md`, optionally `.codex/skills/deep-review/SKILL.md`

### Issue 20: Repo sync/promote/bootstrap plumbing treated `conduct` as Claude-only before Phase 8
- **Problem**: Before Phase 8, the repo's distribution machinery kept `conduct` out of the mirrored skill set. README, AGENTS, and the four sync/promote/bootstrap/check scripts routed `conduct` through `CLAUDE_ONLY_SKILLS`.
- **Solution**: Phase 8 updated the distribution defaults and docs in the same branch that landed Codex `conduct`, so the repo no longer advertises a Codex skill that the normal promote/sync/bootstrap workflow does not manage.
- **Files affected**: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.env.example`, `scripts/sync-skills.sh`, `scripts/promote-skills.sh`, `scripts/bootstrap-skills.sh`, `scripts/check-sync.sh`

### Issue 21: Codex implementation seam is unspecified
- **Problem**: The plan currently says Codex `conduct` preserves the same contracts as Claude `conduct`, but without naming whether Codex gets its own helper modules or shares Claude's Python implementation. That leaves the most drift-prone part of the port undefined.
- **Solution**: Codex v1 gets its own helper modules under `.codex/skills/conduct/`, with the same contract-level tests as Claude. Shared-library extraction is a later refactor, not part of this milestone.
- **Files affected**: `.codex/skills/conduct/*.py`, `.codex/skills/conduct/tests/*`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `/conduct <plan-path>` runs a 2-phase scratch plan end-to-end without intervention on the happy path. Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_multi_phase_via_resume_advances_one_phase_at_a_time`.
- [x] Conductor pauses between phases with a handback message that prints the literal `Run: /conduct --resume <plan>` line. Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_happy_path_single_phase_commits_and_hands_back`.
- [x] Fix loop respawns implementer by default; respawns test-writer on the next iteration when implementer flags `test_contract_mismatch: true`; terminates at N=3 with blocker message. Covered by `test_assertion_failure_respawns_implementer_and_passes_on_iteration_1`, `test_test_contract_mismatch_routes_iteration_1_to_test_writer`, `test_fix_loop_cap_blocks_after_three_iterations`.
- [x] Preflight hard-stops when plan lacks marker OR marker hash mismatches current content (with final-line-only strip semantics); covered by `tests/test_preflight.py`. Pre-existing lint/hook portion still relies on conductor wiring at runtime (SKILL.md Preflight §3).
- [x] Pre-commit-hook failures at phase boundary count as fix-loop iterations, not hard errors. Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_precommit_hook_failure_routes_to_fix_loop`.
- [x] Malformed subagent JSON → `schema_error` status + handback; no silent retry. `schema.parse_report` raises `SchemaError` for missing blocks, parse failures, role mismatch, missing keys, wrong types; `tests/test_schema.py` covers all paths.
- [x] Rogue commits by subagents are detected via HEAD comparison and flagged in state; conductor does not stack a second commit. Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_rogue_commit_detection_does_not_stack_a_second_commit`.
- [x] All subagent prompts are filled templates; no inline prose in the body of `SKILL.md` other than workflow text. `implementer-prompt.md`, `test-writer-prompt.md`, `reviewer-prompt.md` ship as standalone templates with placeholders only; SKILL.md references them by path. `tests/test_skill_spawn_grep.sh` enforces the no-skill-spawn contract.
- [x] `/review-plan` writes the marker after user acceptance; `review-plan/SKILL.md` constraint lines updated to reflect the footer carve-out; Phase 1 shipped independently before Phase 6 self-host. `.claude/skills/review-plan/SKILL.md` carries the carve-out on lines 13 and 149–176.
- [x] `<repo-root>/.conduct/state-<plan-id>.json` supports `--resume`, `--status`, `--pause-phase`, `--abort-run` with Python `fcntl.flock` locking (no dependency on `flock(1)`). Covered by `tests/test_state.py` + harness tests for each flag; `lock.py` uses `fcntl.flock` with atomic `mkdir` fallback.
- [x] Commit per phase with message `conduct: phase N — <title>`; author = current git user. Covered by harness tests; self-host commit `fc2d849` (`conduct: phase 6 — Manual verification`) is a real-world demonstration.
- [x] `--test-timeout` proven by `tests/test_runner.py` (Python-native subprocess timeout, no coreutils dep). `--max-iterations` and `--test-cmd` are conductor-side wiring still pending end-to-end demonstration. (agent-timeout deferred to post-v1.)
- [x] `--pause-phase` uses `git stash -u`; `--abort-run` only touches state; no `reset --hard` prompts surface. Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_pause_phase_stashes_and_marks_state` and `test_abort_run_deletes_state_without_touching_tree`. `abort_run` also clears the lockfile/lockdir alongside state.
- [x] Producer-side contracts are aligned wherever plans must be `/conduct`-ready across harnesses: `review-plan` marker semantics and `dev-plan` per-phase slots are documented in the relevant Claude/Codex skills. Claude side is done; Codex side landed in Phase 8.
- [x] Docs updated in `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, harness-specific skill docs, and any sync/bootstrap docs touched by the chosen incarnation path. Claude side is done; Codex-side doc updates landed in Phase 8.
- [x] Automated tests under `.claude/skills/conduct/tests/` pass: parser, marker-hash, state, skill-spawn-grep, schema, runner, preflight (53 passing).
- [x] Sentinel test confirms no parent-conversation text leaks into subagent prompts. Covered by `tests/test_conductor_harness.py::test_context_isolation_no_sentinel_leaks_into_rendered_prompts`.
- [x] Codex `conduct` has an explicit implementation seam: `.codex/skills/conduct/` contains its own helper modules and tests, with no implicit runtime dependency on `.claude/skills/conduct/`.
- [x] Repo distribution plumbing no longer treats `conduct` as Claude-only once Phase 8 lands: README, AGENTS, `.env.example`, and sync/promote/bootstrap/check defaults are updated together with the new Codex skill.
- [x] Codex `/conduct` uses `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent` (or the explicitly documented fallback policy) while preserving the same report schema, handback command, and state-file contract as Claude `/conduct`
- [x] `deep-review` remains independent of `.conduct` runtime state; any edits there are limited to workflow/documentation positioning
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved (regular review + `/deep-review`)
- [x] All Phase 6 manual scenarios pass (including rogue-commit, schema-error, marker-in-body safety, pre-existing lint failure). All 21 Phase 6 scenarios ticked; harness + preflight + schema + runner tests cover them deterministically.
- [x] Documentation updated

## Final Results

### Summary

Claude and Codex now both have `/conduct` incarnations with shared plan contracts, and the Codex side ships its own helper modules, tests, and mirror-plumbing updates. A follow-up review on the Codex branch exposed resume/lock safety gaps and a Python-lint probe blind spot; those were patched in the same branch before sign-off.

### Outcomes

- Claude Phase 1–7 implementation remained intact while Phase 8 added the Codex-native `/conduct` skill under `.codex/skills/conduct/`.
- Codex producer skills (`/dev-plan`, `/review-plan`) now emit the same plan slots and marker semantics expected by `/conduct`.
- Repo sync/promote/bootstrap/check tooling now treats `conduct` as a mirrored managed skill instead of a Claude-only exception.
- Post-review hardening added an explicit `--resume` gate, state/plan identity validation, non-destructive `--abort-run` lock handling, safe flock semantics, and repo-wide Python lint detection for the conduct subtree.

### Learnings

- Shared contracts matter more than verbatim skill mirroring: producer-side plan format and review markers were the real interoperability seam.
- Flock-backed locks should never be garbage-collected by path age alone; stale handling must respect the underlying lock primitive.
- The preflight probe needs to reflect repo layout rather than assume top-level language entrypoints.

### Follow-up Work

- **Skill namespacing** (`workflow:dev-plan`, `workflow:conduct`, …) — evaluate after conduct proves the workflow.
- **Codex delegation-unavailable policy** — if some Codex environments cannot delegate, decide whether `/conduct` should degrade to main-session execution or hard-stop with a clear diagnostic.
- **Shared helper extraction** — if Claude/Codex helper modules drift enough to become a maintenance burden, extract a shared conduct helper library in a later refactor rather than during the initial Codex port.
- **LLM-based fix-loop classifier** — current design leans on the implementer's self-reported flag. If misrouting is common in practice, consider a tiny classifier call.
