# update-docs (origin) and deep-review (Phase 1 copy). Add more skill
# paths to TARGETS as the snippet propagates.

# Exits 0 on parity, 1 on drift. Output is silent on parity, lists the
# offending skills + a unified diff against the canonical (first) copy
# on drift.
#
# The snippet is defined as the contiguous block beginning with
# `BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` and ending at the
# closing `fi` of the main/master fallback (5 lines including the seed).
